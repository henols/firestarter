     * part in Output Disable for every verify and the loop never converges.

     * Datasheet floors (W27C512 AC programming characteristics): TOES

     * UPPER BOUND, and it is hard: at per-pulse granularity anything above
     * ~7 ms costs 1024 x that per block and turns a working write into a

     * ceiling of 16383 us.

     * Diagnosing a bad value: too small and every pulse is ineffective,
