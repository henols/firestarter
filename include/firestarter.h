// The single shared value-semantics default for the DEV_TOOLS switch,
// so the same directive means the same thing on every target (AVR, native,
// native_nodevtools and ARM/py32f071) instead of one presence-semantics
// mechanism on AVR/native and a different by-omission mechanism on ARM,
// where DEV_TOOLS=0 would perversely ENABLE dev tools under the old
// #ifdef-based test. Placed INSIDE the __FIRESTARTER_H__ guard, beside
// DATA_BUFFER_SIZE above (the in-tree precedent for exactly this idiom) --
// placing it above the guard instead causes the host-repo parity test's
// _find_header_guard_line_indices to misidentify the real guard, and the
// test then passes only by an arithmetic cancellation between a spurious
// #endif decrement and an un-skipped #ifndef increment (correction C-18),
// never for the right reason. Honest scope caveat (correction C-7): two of
// the six conversion sites -- include/dev_tools.h and src/dev_tools.cpp --
// test DEV_TOOLS before including anything, so this default is not
// syntactically in scope there. Behaviour is still correct at those two
// sites without it: ISO C/C++ evaluates an undefined identifier inside a
// preprocessor #if expression as 0, which is exactly this default's value,
// so the block below is documentary (not load-bearing) at those two sites.
// If -Wundef is ever enabled, those two sites will need this default pulled
// into a dependency-free header included unconditionally at their top.

// were the only two free command values, and BOTH sit above
// CMD_DEV_ADDRESS (7): that is exactly why the #ifdef DEV_TOOLS-conditional
// ordinal admission guard had to be replaced by is_memory_cmd() (below)
// BEFORE these could be defined (D-03, LOCK-03 is a hard prerequisite for
// LOCK-02) -- with the old guard in place, a DEV_TOOLS build would have
// routed 9/10 into the dev-tools branch and never called configure_memory,
// leaving the new commands with no bus configuration at all.
// Both defines are UNCONDITIONAL (never DEV_TOOLS-gated): they are real
// user-facing operations in every build. The host CLI surface
// (`firestarter dev sdp <chip> enable|disable`, constants.py CMD_SDP_* /
// COMMAND_NAMES) arrives in Phase 120 HOST-01/HOST-03 -- firmware-before-host.

// (CMD_READ_VPP..CMD_HW_VERSION occupy 11-15, and slots 9 and 10 were the
// only two free command values below that, per the
// CMD_SDP_UNLOCK/CMD_SDP_LOCK comment above). This IS a memory command: the
// protection-status read is issued through handle->firestarter_get_data,
// a protocol-handler function pointer only configure_memory() sets, so it
// needs a protocol handler exactly as CMD_READ/CMD_WRITE/etc do.
#define CMD_LOCK_STATUS 16

// Replaces the #ifdef DEV_TOOLS-conditional ordinal admission guard that
// used to live at firestarter.cpp's parse_json (the old
// `if (handle->cmd < CMD_DEV_ADDRESS)` test, itself wrapped in
// `#ifdef DEV_TOOLS`). That conditional was STRUCTURALLY FORCED, not lazy:
// CMD_DEV_ADDRESS/CMD_DEV_REGISTER only exist under -D DEV_TOOLS, so any
// guard naming them had no choice but to be preprocessor-conditional too.
// is_memory_cmd() removes the need for a conditional entirely by not
// naming those two symbols at all -- it enumerates the commands that
// legitimately configure a memory bus, by name, unconditionally. This
// access-control gate admitted eight commands from Phase 119 until Phase
// 151, and now admits nine: Phase 151 (LOCK-02, OD-3) added CMD_LOCK_STATUS
// as the ninth. rurp_pinmap_guard.h's rurp_pinmap_refuses() DELEGATES to
// this predicate rather than re-listing its set, so the provisional-pinmap
// refusal for CMD_LOCK_STATUS follows automatically from this one edit --
// but that guard's test suite (test_pinmap_provisional) runs in NO CI leg,
// so it is verified with a local `pio test` run, not CI green.
//
// This is a DELIBERATE SAFETY TIGHTENING (D-01), not a preserved behaviour:
// today, a RELEASE build (no -D DEV_TOOLS) still runs json_parse AND
// configure_memory for CMD_DEV_ADDRESS (7) / CMD_DEV_REGISTER (8) before
// loop()'s `default:` refuses them with MSG_ERR_UNKNOWN_CMD -- i.e. it
// configures a memory handler for a command it is about to refuse. An
// honest enumeration excludes 7 and 8, so after this change a release
// build no longer does that; cmd 7 and 8 keep their MSG_ERR_UNKNOWN_CMD
// refusal in a release build, unchanged.
//
// This predicate is an ACCESS-CONTROL GATE, not hygiene: it decides which
// commands may call configure_memory() and therefore configure the
// hardware bus. configure_eprom() (reached only through this gate) enables
// the 12V VPP boost regulator -- a hazard on a 5V part -- so admitting an
// extra command here is a hardware-safety decision, not a style one.
//
// Hard constraints (Plan 119-03's source-scan gate makes the first
// machine-checked):
//  - NO preprocessor conditional of any kind inside this function's body.
//    All nine named macros below are unconditionally defined, so none is
//    needed (D-02).
//  - static inline, IN THIS HEADER (not a .cpp / new translation unit):
//    [env:native]'s build_src_filter compiles only src/proms/,
//    src/boards/rurp_serial_utils.cpp and src/json_parser.c, so a
//    definition anywhere else would not link into the native test binary
//    and Plan 119-02's two-env truth-table suite could not exist.
//  - MUST NOT name CMD_DEV_ADDRESS or CMD_DEV_REGISTER -- those macros do
//    not exist in a no-DEV_TOOLS build (see #ifdef above), and naming them
//    here would recreate exactly the divergence this predicate exists to
//    remove.
