Phase 155 Plan 02 -- the BASE-08 anti-hollow pairing for
scripts/check_no_heap_or_64bit_symbols.py.

Requirements: DEAD-01, DEAD-03

This is the MANDATORY anti-hollow pairing for the DEAD-01/DEAD-03 link-time
symbol-absence gate: a checker with no negative-fixture test is exactly this
project's v1.12 hollow-GATE-03 failure mode -- a gate that could never fail
because nothing concrete was asserted against it. Every planted-violation
test below invokes scripts/check_no_heap_or_64bit_symbols.py as a real
subprocess (list-form argv, never shell=True, never an in-process import),
so a passing suite here proves the checker itself -- not this test module --
goes RED on a real pre-change symbol table and reaches exit 0 on a clean
one.

No `pio` invocation and no live `avr-nm` invocation happens anywhere in this
module: every fixture used here is a committed, captured TEXT `avr-nm`
listing, read via the checker's `--nm-output TARGET=PATH` seam. This keeps
the suite hermetic in CI leg 3, where no AVR toolchain is installed --
mirroring `test_check_size_baseline.py`'s own committed-log convention.

Two of the derived-control fixtures below (Coverage 2 and Coverage 4) are
SYNTHETIC: they are produced at test time by filtering specific lines out of
the one committed REAL negative,
`tests/fixtures/planted_no_heap_or_64bit_symbols_prechange_uno/avr-nm-uno.txt`.
Plan 06 later commits the REAL post-change `uno` listing and adds
`test_real_postchange_listing_exits_zero` alongside this module's synthetic
clean-control leg -- that real positive control does not exist yet, which is
why Coverage 2 is explicit about being synthetic rather than silently
presenting a filtered real fixture as if it were one.

The heap-set and 64-bit-set name lists below are duplicated from
scripts/check_no_heap_or_64bit_symbols.py's own HEAP_SYMBOLS/DI64_SYMBOLS
rather than imported, following this repo's own established idiom of
duplicating small constant sets between a checker and its test (the same
choice tests/test_write_path_source_contract_v131.py's _strip_comments and
scripts/check_erase_no_vpp.py's own copy of it both make) -- this module
tests the checker as an external program via subprocess, and never imports
it in-process.

Coverage:
  1. The committed real pre-change listing exits 1 and names the four
     offending symbols the message must carry.
  2. A synthetic clean listing, derived by deleting the forbidden lines from
     the real pre-change listing (anchors kept), exits 0 and names the
     target.
  3. A missing --nm-output listing path exits exactly 2.
  4. A synthetic clean-but-anchor-stripped listing exits exactly 2 -- the
     leg proving the gate cannot pass vacuously on a listing that is not
     the real firmware.
  5. An unrecognised argv flag exits exactly 2.
  6. A tmp_path baseline whose avr_targets is an empty object exits 1 with
     the never-vacuous wording.
  7. A tmp_path baseline that is not valid JSON exits exactly 2.
  8. The committed fixture is present, non-empty, resolves under
     _REPO_ROOT, and contains at least one line for each forbidden set plus
     both anchors -- a missing or emptied fixture must FAIL, never SKIP.
  9. This module's own source contains no runtime skip-bypass call, no
     skip-marker decorator, and no dependency-skip call.

Self-contained path resolution below -- NOT in conftest.py (firestarter/tests/
has no conftest.py anywhere in the repo; this is a recorded house-rule
pattern decision, per test_update_version.py's own comment, not an
omission). Stdlib and pytest only.
