Phase 158 Plan 02 -- pins the `jsmntok_t` layout Plan 02's own task 1 landed
in lib/jsmn/src/jsmn.h with a committed, non-vacuous source-scan gate.

Requirements: LAND-05

Defect class this closes: the twelve `-1` sentinel field references on six
lines of lib/jsmn/src/jsmn.c (`:15,222,241,256,290,348` -- each line carrying
two field references, `start` and `end`, twelve total) depend on `start` and
`end` staying a SIGNED type. `jsmn_alloc_token` sets `tok->start = tok->end =
-1;` and every closing-bracket branch of `jsmn_parse` tests
`token->start != -1 && token->end == -1` to find the innermost unclosed
token. A future tidy-up narrowing either field to `unsigned` or to a
fixed-width unsigned type (`uint16_t`, for example) would break every one of
those twelve sentinel comparisons SILENTLY -- the code still compiles, and
no other gate in this tree would notice, because `sizeof(jsmntok_t)` cannot
be asserted in a native test (AVR gives 6 B, the host gives 12 B; see the
"sizeof prohibition" section below) and no native suite exercises the
sentinel's *signedness*, only its *behaviour* on inputs that happen not to
trip the bug. This module is a SOURCE CONTRACT: it proves the shipped text
still says `int start;` / `int end;`, never what the compiled code does at
runtime.

Coverage:
  1. test_token_start_and_end_remain_signed_int -- within the LIVE
     jsmntok struct region only (see "Region scope" below), exactly one
     `int start;` member declaration and exactly one `int end;` member
     declaration, and no unsigned or fixed-width integer type is applied
     to either member name anywhere in that region.
  2. test_token_type_and_size_are_uint8 -- within the same region, exactly
     one `uint8_t type;` and exactly one `uint8_t size;`, so a revert of
     task 1's narrowing is also loud.
  3. test_scan_target_is_non_vacuous -- the default scan target
     (recomputed fresh from _REPO_ROOT, never reading the environment
     seam) exists, is non-empty, resolves inside this repository, its
     comment-and-literal-stripped text is non-empty, AND the live-header
     region sliced from it is also non-empty.
  4. test_this_module_cannot_be_silently_skipped -- this module's own
     source contains no skip-bypass call, no skip-marker decorator and no
     dependency-skip call anywhere.
  5. test_own_needles_do_not_appear_verbatim_in_this_module -- the
     concatenation-built needles used by Coverage 4 appear nowhere
     verbatim in this module's own source, so this gate cannot match
     itself.

Region scope (load-bearing -- read before editing this module).
lib/jsmn/src/jsmn.h carries a DEAD DUPLICATE IMPLEMENTATION starting at the
`#ifndef JSMN_HEADER` line, guarded by a `#define JSMN_HEADER` that precedes
it earlier in the same file -- so that whole second copy of jsmntok-adjacent
code compiles in NO translation unit, but is live TEXT to a naive grep or
regex scan (OD-6, ceiling 9). A gate that scanned the WHOLE file could be
satisfied by a correct-looking `int start;` / `int end;` pair sitting in the
dead copy while the LIVE struct above it had been silently narrowed --
passing vacuously on exactly the defect it exists to catch. This module
therefore scans ONLY the region of the (comment-and-literal-stripped)
header text from its start up to the first occurrence of the literal marker
`#ifndef JSMN_HEADER` (stored in `_LIVE_STRUCT_END_MARKER`), via
`_live_header_region`. `_live_header_region` RAISES rather than falling
back to scanning the whole file if that marker is not found -- a missing
marker means the header's structure changed underneath this module, which
is a reason to fail loudly, not a licence to widen the scan (Coverage 3's
own non-vacuity leg also runs `_live_header_region` over the real file, so
a marker rename is caught there too).

sizeof prohibition. This module asserts NOTHING about `sizeof(jsmntok_t)`.
`jsmntok_t` is 6 bytes on AVR (uint8_t + uint8_t + int + int, no padding at
`-Os`) and 12 bytes on the pytest host (int is commonly 4 bytes there, plus
alignment padding before the two `int` members) -- asserting a fixed size
in a module that Python, not avr-gcc, imports and executes would be
asserting the HOST's sizeof, which proves nothing about the shipped AVR
binary. `src/json_parser.c`'s `field_desc_t` documents the identical
prohibition for its own sibling struct (grep
"ASSERTION ON sizeof(field_desc_t) MAY BE AUTHORED WITHOUT A TARGET GUARD"
in that file). The RAM saving this module's Task 1 commit records is
witnessed by the linker's own `RAM: used N` line and by `avr-nm -S` on a
real atmega328p object file -- never by a native `sizeof` expression
(ceiling 6).

Environment seams: (this repository has no central environment-variable
inventory -- this docstring is the only place a reader can discover them)
  - FIRESTARTER_JSMN_TOKEN_LAYOUT_SCAN_SOURCE -- overrides the scanned
    lib/jsmn/src/jsmn.h path. Binds at IMPORT time (the module-level
    `Path(os.environ.get(...))` expression below), so `monkeypatch.setenv`
    CANNOT move it after this module has already been imported by pytest's
    collection phase -- a planted-violation run that exercises this seam
    must set the variable in a CHILD PROCESS environment (a subprocess
    invocation of `python3 -m pytest` against this one module) before this
    module is imported there, never via a post-import monkeypatch.
    Coverage 3 (the non-vacuity leg) deliberately never reads it: it
    recomputes the default target directly from `_REPO_ROOT`, so it stays
    meaningful even when the seam is pointed elsewhere for a probe.
    Coverage 4 and 5 read only this module's own source and never touch
    the seam either. A stray seam value left set after a planted run
    cannot make Coverage 1 or 2 pass vacuously -- at worst it makes them
    fail loudly (a FileNotFoundError surfaces from Path.read_text() when
    the overridden path does not exist), which is exactly Probe C's own
    shape (see this module's own commit message and the plan's SUMMARY for
    the recorded outcome).

CI coverage, stated CORRECTLY (not copied from the boolean-convention
analog, whose own equivalent paragraph is stale in exactly the way Plan 05
of this phase corrects in tests/test_check_size_baseline.py and
tests/meta_presence.py -- see C-9 in .planning/v1.33/158-before-figures.md).
`pytest tests/ -v` DOES fire on this milestone branch: it appears at
.github/workflows/build.yml:161, ungated by any `if:`, and that workflow's
own `on:` block filters `push: branches: ['**', '!beta']` -- `'**'` matches
every branch including `gsd/v1.33-source-hygiene-firmware-size-reduction`,
and only `beta` itself is excluded. This module therefore IS exercised by
CI on this branch, as part of that one `pytest tests/ -v` step, the moment
this commit is pushed.

This module is a standalone pytest module: it is not named check_*.py (that
glob belongs to a different, paired convention this module does not need),
it adds no shared pytest configuration or fixture-registration file, and it
imports nothing beyond the Python standard library. It never imports,
parametrizes against, or edits any pre-existing gate module; the scanning
logic below is its own independent re-derivation of this plan's own gate
specification, modelled in shape on
tests/test_boolean_convention_source_contract_v133.py (the smallest of the
four in-tree source-contract gates) but scanning different text for a
different defect class.
