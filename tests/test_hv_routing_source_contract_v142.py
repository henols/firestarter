Phase 142 Plan 06 -- authors the one test this phase owes (D-09) and the
structural half of VPP-03's evidence, as a single new pytest gate module.

Requirements: VPP-02, VPP-03

Defect class this closes: TWO distinct gaps, neither of which any existing
gate covers --

  (a) D-09 reads command_done() (src/firestarter.cpp:162-171) as the
      operation-level disable: it zeroes CONTROL_REGISTER,
      LEAST_SIGNIFICANT_BYTE and MOST_SIGNIFICANT_BYTE on BOTH the
      timeout-abort arm of loop() and the `if (finished)` arm, and because
      the top-address bits and the vpp_line bit all live in those three
      registers, that zeroing fully de-energises every route this phase
      touches. `grep -rn command_done src/ test/` today returns four
      declarations/definitions/calls, one prose mention, and four comments
      in test_loop_eprom_v131.cpp explaining why that suite deliberately
      does NOT drive it -- zero assertions. A BEHAVIOURAL oracle is
      impossible without breaking D-14: firestarter.cpp sits outside every
      native environment's build_src_filter (`+<proms/>
      +<boards/rurp_serial_utils.cpp> +<json_parser.c>
      +<operation_utils.cpp>` -- see test/native/avr/_shared/
      host_stubs_common.inc:317-335's op_reset_timeout stub and its comment
      explaining exactly this exclusion), and pulling it in would collide
      with the suite's own main() and require a SEVENTH native
      environment, which D-14 forbids. This module's command_done legs are
      therefore a SOURCE-CONTRACT claim, not a behavioural one: they prove
      the source SAYS the right thing; they do not, and cannot, prove the
      AVR EXECUTES it. Named non-claim, stated rather than left inferable:
      that command_done() actually runs on the real AVR abort path is not
      provable here, because that arm's guard depends on millis() and is
      outside every native suite's reach.

  (b) VPP-03's structural half. Plan 142-05's task 2 already proves the
      BEHAVIOURAL half (eprom_check_vpp and the write path emit the same
      physical control byte). The re-derived branch-inventory golden
      (tests/golden/protocol_branch_inventory.json, tier-1 3 -> 1) proves
      the write path's predicate SHAPE moved, but it does not prove the
      underlying MECHANISM is a single shared resolver and a single shared
      pair of composite masks rather than duplication merely relocated
      somewhere else in the same file. This module supplies exactly that
      structural proof: one resolver definition, at least two call sites,
      zero surviving equality predicates keyed on a second algorithm
      selector, exactly one definition of each composite across include/,
      and no surviving hand-rolled equivalent of either composite.

L-12, stated rather than implied: D-03's non-claim discipline (no
unqualified "fixed"/"conformant" language about silicon this phase cannot
measure) is enforced by PROSE ONLY on this branch -- CLOSE-01's
check_permitted_claims.py is Phase 146's, and Phase 139 shipped only a
Phase-139-scoped script. This module does not enforce that discipline and
must not be read as if it did; it enforces only the two claims named above.

Coverage:
  1. test_command_done_is_defined_exactly_once -- exactly one definition of
     command_done(firestarter_handle_t* handle) in the comment-stripped
     dispatcher source. Source-contract claim (see above).
  2. test_command_done_body_zeroes_all_three_latch_registers_individually
     -- command_done's own body (extracted by brace-matching, so a write
     elsewhere in the file cannot satisfy this leg) contains exactly three
     rurp_write_to_register(<reg>, 0x00) calls, and each of
     CONTROL_REGISTER, LEAST_SIGNIFICANT_BYTE and MOST_SIGNIFICANT_BYTE is
     asserted individually, not merely as a count of three.
  3. test_command_done_is_called_from_both_dispatch_arms_individually --
     at least two total command_done(&handle) call sites, with the
     timeout-abort branch of loop() and the `if (finished)` branch each
     asserted separately, so a future deletion of either arm fails this
     gate on the arm it removed, not merely on a total.
  4. test_command_done_sets_the_command_to_idle -- command_done's own body
     assigns the idle command to handle->cmd; a command_done that zeroed
     every register but left the command state live would not actually
     end the operation.
  5. test_write_execute_and_write_init_wrappers_disable_conditionally --
     VPP-03 presence leg pairing two counts in one message (so the
     wrapper's CONDITIONAL shape is what is pinned, not two unrelated
     counts): at least two comparisons gating on an error response code,
     and at least two references to the shared all-off composite, in the
     comment-stripped write path.
  6. test_route_resolver_is_defined_exactly_once -- exactly one definition
     of the EPROM high-voltage route resolver returning rurp_register_t.
  7. test_route_resolver_is_called_from_at_least_two_sites -- at least two
     call sites of that resolver, each passing the handle.
  8. test_write_execute_body_is_defined_exactly_once_as_static -- exactly
     one static definition of the write-execute inner body.
  9. test_write_init_body_is_defined_exactly_once_as_static -- exactly one
     static definition of the write-init inner body.
  10. test_each_hv_composite_is_defined_exactly_once_across_include --
      exactly one #define of each of the two EPROM high-voltage composite
      masks across every header under include/ (globbed, not seamed -- see
      Environment seams below), plus a leg that the all-off composite's
      own #define line does not name the P1-routing bit (correction C-4).
  11. test_no_second_algorithm_selector_predicate_survives_in_the_write_path
      -- zero matches for an equality comparison keyed on handle->protocol
      (the shape of the two removed hand-rolled forks) in the
      comment-stripped write path, needle concatenation-built. Named after
      what it forbids (a second algorithm selector), never after the
      token -- see the Naming note below.
  12. test_no_literal_regulator_and_drop_bit_or_sequence_survives -- zero
      matches for the regulator-enable bit and the drop-enable bit joined
      by a literal bitwise-OR, in either order, in the comment-stripped
      write path -- both needles concatenation-built.
  13. test_the_deleted_dead_regulator_guard_helper_does_not_return -- zero
      matches for Open Question 6's deleted dead regulator-enable guard
      helper's identifier, anywhere under src/ or include/, needle
      concatenation-built. Named after what the helper did, never after
      its identifier -- see the Naming note below.
  14. test_scan_targets_are_non_vacuous -- every default scan target (the
      two files AND the include/ directory) exists, is non-empty, resolves
      inside this repository, and (for the two files) has non-empty
      comment-stripped text. A missing or empty scan target must FAIL,
      never silently pass as if nothing needed checking.
  15. test_this_module_cannot_be_silently_skipped -- this module's own
      source contains no skip-bypass call, no skip-marker decorator and no
      import-or-skip call anywhere, each checked via a concatenation-built
      needle.
  16. test_own_needles_do_not_appear_verbatim_in_this_module -- every
      concatenation-built needle from Coverage 11-13 appears nowhere
      verbatim in this module's own source, so this gate cannot match
      itself.

Environment seams: (this repository has no central environment-variable
inventory -- this docstring is the only place a reader can discover them)
  - FIRESTARTER_HV_SCAN_DISPATCH_SOURCE -- overrides the scanned
    src/firestarter.cpp path ONLY. Consulted by Coverage 1-4 (the
    command_done legs). Binds at IMPORT time (the module-level
    Path(os.environ.get(...)) expression below), so a planted-violation
    run must set it in a CHILD PROCESS environment before this module is
    imported, never via a post-import monkeypatch.
  - FIRESTARTER_HV_SCAN_EPROM_SOURCE -- overrides the scanned
    src/proms/eprom.cpp path ONLY. Consulted by Coverage 5-9 and 11-12 (the
    VPP-03 structural legs against the write path). Binds at import time,
    same as above.
  - include/ has NO seam of its own: Coverage 10 globs a whole directory
    rather than scanning one file, and adding a third seam here would
    contradict this module's own fixed two-seam contract. This module's
    own SUMMARY states explicitly whether Coverage 10 was armed via some
    other mechanism or is recorded as unplanted, and why -- see that
    document, not this docstring, for that decision.
  - Coverage 13 (the deleted dead helper) reads neither seam: it sweeps
    the whole of src/ and include/ by design, not a single seamed file.
  - Coverage 14, 15 and 16 deliberately never read either seam: 14
    recomputes the default targets directly from the repository root
    without ever reading os.environ; 15 and 16 read only this module's own
    source. A stray seam value left set after a planted run cannot make
    any of Coverage 1-13 pass vacuously -- at worst it redirects that leg
    to whatever the seam happens to point at, which fails loudly rather
    than silently.

Naming note (mirrors tests/test_write_path_source_contract_v131.py's own
"Naming note for Coverage 2 and 3"): the deleted dead regulator-enable
guard helper's own identifier, spelled out in full, is a strict substring
of the "obvious" English test name for the leg proving it absent -- so a
test literally named after it would make this module's own source
contain, verbatim, a needle it must instead prove is concatenation-built
(Coverage 16's own check). Coverage 13 is therefore named after what the
helper DID rather than after its identifier; the needle it actually
searches for is still concatenation-built and still exactly the removed
identifier. The same hazard, and the same fix, apply to Coverage 11 and
12: neither test name spells out a handle->protocol equality comparison or
either ordering of the regulator/drop composite's two component bits
joined by a literal OR.

CI framing, stated honestly (mirrors the analog's own section): `pytest
tests/ -v` appears in `.github/workflows/build.yml:161` and
`.github/workflows/beta-build.yml:134`, so this module -- like every other
file under tests/ -- WILL run in CI once this branch reaches `main` or
`beta`. It does not run in any CI leg on the milestone branch itself; that
is a statement about this branch's current CI wiring, not a claim that
this module is permanently invisible to CI.

This module is a standalone pytest module: it is not named check_*.py, it
adds no shared pytest configuration or fixture-registration file anywhere
(firestarter/tests/ has none, by house convention, and this module does
not introduce one), and it imports nothing beyond the Python standard
library. It never imports, parametrizes against, or edits
tests/test_write_path_source_contract_v131.py or
tests/test_protocol_branch_inventory.py -- the scanning logic below is its
own independent re-derivation of this plan's own gate specification, and
neither analog module is modified by this one.
