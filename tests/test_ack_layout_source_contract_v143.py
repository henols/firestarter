Phase 143 Plan 03 (HOST-01, wire half; BF-1 closure) -- pins the
operation-setup ack's pack layout in src/firestarter.cpp: the CAP-01 buffer
size, the PORTED (not invented) CAP-02 hardware-revision / firmware-identity
tail, and this plan's own CAP-03 per-block write-time budget field, all
inside one LOG_OK_ID_BYTES(MSG_OK_READY, ...) emit in init_programmer_framed.

Requirements: HOST-01 (wire half only -- 143-03-PLAN.md's own frontmatter
`requirements: []` is deliberate; this plan marks no requirement Complete).

Defect class this closes: a wire-layout change on ONE side of a two-repo
protocol, with NOTHING comparing the two sides -- BF-1's exact shape.
143-RESEARCH.md's own BF-1 finding is that the v1.31 firmware branch shipped
(and, absent this plan, would have kept shipping) a bare 2-byte MSG_OK_READY
ack while the v1.31 host branch's `_decode_id_frame` already expected a
CAP-02 identity tail at a computed offset -- so a v1.31 firmware build and
the v1.31 host COULD NOT CONNECT AT ALL, and no gate in either repository
noticed, because nothing compared the two sides of this one wire field
(143-PATTERNS.md's "No Analog Found" table names this gap explicitly).

This module closes the FIRMWARE half of that gap: it pins the pack layout
this file emits, byte for byte, so a future edit that narrows, reorders or
mis-sizes the pack cannot land silently. It does NOT perform a live
cross-repo comparison against firestarter_app/firestarter/serial_comm.py's
decoder -- that standing gate is handed to Phase 144 / TEST-07
(143-RESEARCH.md Open Question 4). The HOST half of this same layout is
independently pinned by plan 143-02's `_cap03_params` fixture in
firestarter_app/tests/test_hw_revision_gate.py, decoded by the real
`_decode_id_frame` at two identity lengths -- this module never imports or
reads anything from that other repository.

Coverage:
  1. test_the_retired_two_byte_ready_emit_is_gone -- the retired
     two-byte-only ack emit macro, paired with MSG_OK_READY, appears ZERO
     times in the comment-stripped init_programmer_framed body. Needle
     concatenation-built so this module's own prose cannot satisfy it by
     accident. BF-1: this is the exact emit shape that made a v1.31
     firmware build unreachable by the v1.31 host.
  2. test_exactly_one_byte_blob_ready_emit_exists -- the byte-blob form of
     the same ack, paired with MSG_OK_READY, appears EXACTLY once in that
     body. Two emits would make the ack's shape depend on a code path,
     defeating the host's one and only length-based discriminator.
  3. test_the_ready_pack_buffer_has_room_for_the_budget -- the pack buffer
     is declared with room for the identity tail AND the two budget bytes.
     A buffer sized for the identity tail alone would overflow by two
     bytes on a 32-character identity once the budget is written; nothing
     here may be sized from frame content.
  4. test_the_budget_is_written_at_a_computed_offset_not_a_literal -- the
     budget's two bytes are written at the COMPUTED offset (never a
     literal), and no other index into the pack buffer, anywhere in the
     body, is a bare decimal greater than 3. D-08's hazard: a fixed index
     works for one identity length and silently misreads the next.
  5. test_the_emitted_length_accounts_for_the_budget -- the emitted byte
     count includes the budget's two bytes. Omitting them would silently
     truncate the budget off the wire and leave the host's corresponding
     attribute None forever -- a SILENT capability loss, not a loud one.
  6. test_the_budget_comes_from_the_shipped_budget_function -- the budget
     is computed by CALLING the shipped budget function (D-07), and none
     of three named hand-rolled-restatement needles (each concatenation-
     built) appears anywhere in the body: the arithmetic (already padded
     per D-09) lives in src/proms/eprom_budget.cpp and is unit-tested
     there, never duplicated at the ack site.
  7. test_the_revision_byte_is_emitted_on_every_build_configuration -- the
     hardware-revision byte is assigned on BOTH the detection-compiled-in
     arm and the no-detection arm, so the ack's byte count depends only on
     the identity-string length, never on build configuration.
  8. test_scan_targets_are_non_vacuous -- self-protection, two halves. The
     FIRST half recomputes the DEFAULT scan target fresh from the repo
     root, never via the environment seam, and checks it is sane. The
     SECOND half runs the body-extractor against whatever the (seam-aware)
     scan target CURRENTLY resolves to and requires a non-empty body --
     this is the half a planted EMPTY scratch file turns RED, proving a
     silently-empty extraction cannot make every negative-assertion leg
     above (1 and 6) pass vacuously.
  9. test_this_module_cannot_be_silently_skipped -- this module's own
     source contains no skip-bypass call, no skip-marker decorator and no
     import-or-skip call anywhere, each needle concatenation-built.
  10. test_own_needles_do_not_appear_verbatim_in_this_module -- every
      concatenation-built needle from Coverage 1, 6 and 9 (seven needles
      total) appears NOWHERE verbatim in this module's own source.

Environment seams: (this repository has no central environment-variable
inventory -- this docstring is the only place a reader can discover them,
mirroring tests/test_hv_routing_source_contract_v142.py's own convention)
  - FIRESTARTER_ACK_SCAN_DISPATCH_SOURCE -- overrides the scanned
    src/firestarter.cpp path ONLY. Consulted by Coverage 1-7 and the SECOND
    half of Coverage 8. Binds at IMPORT time (the module-level
    `Path(os.environ.get(...))` expression below), so a planted-violation
    run must set it in a CHILD PROCESS environment before this module is
    imported, never via a post-import monkeypatch.
  - Coverage 8's FIRST half, Coverage 9 and Coverage 10 deliberately never
    read this seam: Coverage 8's first half recomputes the default target
    directly from the repository root without ever reading os.environ (the
    check_permitted_claims.py `_HERE`-resolves-to-the-wrong-directory
    landmine, closed here by construction, the same technique
    test_hv_routing_source_contract_v142.py's own Coverage 14 uses); 9 and
    10 read only this module's own source. A stray seam value left set
    after a planted run cannot make Coverage 8's first half, 9 or 10 pass
    vacuously -- at worst Coverage 1-7 and Coverage 8's second half redirect
    to whatever the seam happens to point at, which fails loudly rather
    than silently.

Naming note (mirrors test_hv_routing_source_contract_v142.py's own): no test
name above spells out any of the four forbidden-restatement needles or the
three skip needles verbatim -- each is named after what it forbids (a
retired emit shape, a hand-rolled restatement, a skip mechanism), never
after its exact token, so this module's own test names cannot become the
thing Coverage 10 has to catch.

CI framing, stated honestly (mirrors the analog's own section): `pytest
tests/ -v` appears in `.github/workflows/build.yml:161` and
`.github/workflows/beta-build.yml:134`, so this module -- like every other
file under tests/ -- WILL run in CI once this branch reaches `main` or
`beta`. It does not run in any CI leg on the milestone branch itself; that
is a statement about this branch's current CI wiring, not a claim that this
module is permanently invisible to CI.

This module is a standalone pytest module: it is not named check_*.py, it
adds no shared pytest configuration or fixture-registration file anywhere
(firestarter/tests/ has none, by house convention, and this module does not
introduce one), and it imports nothing beyond the Python standard library
(os, re, pathlib). It never imports, parametrizes against, or edits
tests/test_hv_routing_source_contract_v142.py or any other existing gate
module -- the scanning logic below is its own independent re-derivation of
this plan's own gate specification.
