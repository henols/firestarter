Phase 129 Plan 01 -- D-03's meta-repo presence probe for the flash-path
record sync gate.

Requirements: PCB-01, PCB-02, PCB-03, PCB-04, PCB-05 (presence-probe slice
only -- this module does NOT close any of them, and no requirement is
marked complete in REQUIREMENTS.md from this plan).

Decisions covered: D-03, D-04

**Direction warning, unique to this module.** The relationship here is
*parent*, not sibling: `firestarter` is a **submodule of** the meta repo, so
the meta root is `Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent` -- one
level further up than `firestarter_app/tests/fw_presence.py`'s sibling
arithmetic (that module's app repo and the firmware repo are siblings under
a common parent; this repo's meta root IS that common parent). Under
`actions/checkout` of `henols/firestarter` in isolation, that parent
directory is simply the runner's work directory and `.planning/` does not
exist there at all (RESEARCH F-14) -- an entirely ordinary absent-repo case,
not an error.

**`.git` is probed with `.exists()`, never a directory-only check.** A
submodule checkout stores `.git` as a *file* (a gitlink pointer into the
superproject's `.git/modules/...`); the superproject's own `.git` is a
*directory*. The marker probed here is the superproject's (meta repo)
marker, so under this project's real checkout it normally IS a directory --
but the code must not depend on that, because the exact same probe logic
runs against synthetic `tmp_path` fixtures in
`test_flash_path_record_sync.py`, some of which create `.git` as a plain
file to prove the probe does not silently require a directory.

**Import-time binding -- read this before writing a test against this
module.** `META_ROOT`, `META_MARKER`, `META_PRESENT`, `META_ABSENT_REASON`
and `requires_meta` are all evaluated once, at import (the
`FIRESTARTER_META_ROOT` env seam below is read at module scope, and
`pytest.mark.skipif` binds at collection). `monkeypatch.setenv` runs *after*
import and collection have already happened, so it has **no effect** on any
of these names. A test that needs a different `META_ROOT` must invoke
pytest in a **subprocess**, with `FIRESTARTER_META_ROOT` set in the child
process's environment -- never an in-process monkeypatch, never a direct
import of this module under a patched environment.

**CI coverage, stated honestly.** `pytest tests/ -v` at the `build.yml` step read
this session DOES fire on this branch -- that workflow's trigger was widened to
`push: branches: ['**', '!beta']`, documented in `build.yml`'s own header comment,
so it runs on every branch except `beta`; `beta-build.yml` runs the sibling leg on
`push: branches: [beta]`; and `py32f071.yml` still has no pytest step at all. Never
imply CI coverage where none exists, and never imply its ABSENCE where it does --
this paragraph exists because an earlier reading of this module made exactly that
inverse error.
