Phase 123 Plan 06 — BASE-08's convention-derived meta-test.

Requirements: BASE-08
Decisions covered: D-06, D-08

BASE-08 requires that every checker introduced in v1.23 ships with a
committed planted-violation fixture and a pytest proving the checker's
non-zero exit against it. D-08 makes the filesystem convention the single
source of truth for that requirement -- no registry file lists the
checkers, and no allow-list grandfathers an exception -- with a hardcoded
floor so a zero-match (or shrunken) glob FAILS rather than passing
vacuously.

SCOPE (the load-bearing decision of this module): `CHECKER_GLOB` globs
`check_*.py` in `firestarter/scripts/` ONLY, non-recursively -- a single
directory level, never a recursive descent. It never reaches into
`firestarter_app/tools/`.

This scope is not an arbitrary narrowing. 123-RESEARCH.md's "BASE-08: The
Convention Is Not Universal" (Correction C-6) measured the convention
host-repo-wide: 7 checkers exist across both repos, and only 4 of them
conform to the `check_X.py` <-> `test_check_X.py` <-> `planted_X*` shape.
The 3 violators all live in `firestarter_app/tools/` and all predate
v1.23:

  - `check_dispatch.py` -- its test is named `test_check_dispatch_invariants.py`,
    not `test_check_dispatch.py`.
  - `check_sdp_capability_invariants.py` -- its test is named
    `test_check_sdp_capability.py`, not
    `test_check_sdp_capability_invariants.py`.
  - `check_mypy_watermark.py` -- has NO paired test at all (zero references
    anywhere in `tests/`). This is a genuine gap, not a blessed one, and it
    is recorded here rather than silently fixed or silently ignored,
    because remediating it is out of this phase's scope (BASE-08 targets
    checkers "introduced in this milestone", and `check_mypy_watermark.py`
    is pre-existing v1.18-era tooling).

A repo-wide or recursive version of this meta-test would therefore be RED
on arrival against debt this phase did not create. Scoping to
`firestarter/scripts/` is not a dodge: D-06 put every v1.23 firmware
checker in that one directory, which contained zero Python checkers (only
one shell script, `check_uno_ram.sh`) before this phase. That makes the
glob exactly the "introduced in this milestone" set BASE-08 names, with no
registry file (forbidden by D-08) and no grandfather allow-list (which
would silently bless the 3 violators above rather than naming them).

FLOOR = 5 -- the number of `check_*.py` files actually shipped into
`firestarter/scripts/` across Phases 123-124: `check_size_baseline.py`,
`check_build_warnings.py`, `check_cmake_manifest.py`,
`check_orphan_provisional.py` (Phase 123) and `check_landing_range.py`
(Phase 124 Plan 01, MERGE-01). FIXTURE_FLOOR = 10 -- the number of
`planted_*` entries actually present in `firestarter/tests/fixtures/` at
authoring time, including Phase 124's `planted_landing_range_replayed_history/`
recipe stub. Both floors are hardcoded integer literals asserted with
`>=` before any per-checker assertion runs, so a zero-match glob, an
accidental deletion, or a shrunken fixture set all FAIL instead of passing
silently. A later phase that adds a firmware checker under
`firestarter/scripts/` raises both floors deliberately in the SAME commit
that adds the checker; lowering a floor is never the correct response to a
red gate here -- it means a checker, test, or fixture went missing.

Tests (one named function each):

  1. test_glob_is_non_vacuous -- at least FLOOR checkers are found via
     CHECKER_GLOB, asserted with the observed count and the floor in the
     failure message.
  2. test_every_checker_has_paired_test_module -- for each
     `scripts/check_<X>.py`, `tests/test_check_<X>.py` must exist. Every
     missing pair is collected and reported in ONE assertion message
     rather than failing on the first found.
  3. test_every_checker_has_planted_fixture -- for each `check_<X>.py`, at
     least one entry in `tests/fixtures/` must match `planted_<X>*`,
     counting directories as well as files (two of this phase's fixtures,
     `planted_cmake_manifest_missing_source` and
     `planted_orphan_provisional_macro`, are trees, not plain files).
  4. test_fixture_directory_is_non_vacuous -- the total `planted_*` count
     in `tests/fixtures/` is `>= FIXTURE_FLOOR`.
  5. test_paired_test_module_names_its_checker -- each paired test
     module's source text must contain its checker's exact filename. A
     pairing that exists by name alone but tests something else entirely
     would satisfy tests 2-4 while proving nothing -- the hollow shape
     this whole requirement targets.
  6. test_paired_test_module_asserts_nonzero_exit -- each paired test
     module's source text must contain a `returncode != 0` assertion
     somewhere. This is deliberately a coarse textual check, not a
     semantic proof -- the semantic proof that the checker actually fails
     on its planted violation lives in each module's own tests. This test
     only guards the convention that SOME non-zero-exit assertion exists
     in the file at all.
  7. test_scope_is_firmware_only -- the resolved glob directory's path
     ends in `firestarter/scripts`, and no path in the glob's result set
     contains the substring `firestarter_app`.

Self-contained path resolution below -- NOT in conftest.py
(`firestarter/tests/` has no conftest.py anywhere in the repo; a recorded
house-rule pattern, per test_update_version.py's own comment, not an
omission). Stdlib and pytest only.
