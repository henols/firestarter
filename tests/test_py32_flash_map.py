Phase 126 Plan 06 -- CFG-06's map properties as an exit code: the reserved
py32f071 config flash region (platform/py32f071/linker/PY32F071xB_FLASH.ld)
is sector-aligned, lies inside the physical part, holds two slots exactly
one page apart, cannot be reached by the app region, exposes all four
required symbols, and carries D-13's zero-length bootloader seam with its
migration-cost comment intact.

Requirements: CFG-05, CFG-06, CFG-07
Decisions covered: D-10, D-11, D-12, D-13, D-18, C-3, C-4, D-02

This module invokes no compiler -- every assertion below is a textual gate
over committed source, following tests/test_vpp_seam_manual_on_every_board.py
's plain read_text() idiom (`:333-386`), deliberately not parsed into a
structure beyond the minimal region/symbol extraction this gate needs.

Every piece of arithmetic RESEARCH A6 keeps OUT of the linker script lives
here instead: the sector-alignment modulo, the inside-the-physical-part
bounds check, and the app-cannot-reach-config comparison. `ASSERT` with a
modulo on a region origin is the construct RESEARCH A6 rates most likely to
need adjustment on real arm-none-eabi-ld, and no ARM linker exists in this
environment to try it against -- Python, which can actually run the
arithmetic, is the venue instead.

This module executes in NO CI leg on this branch: `pytest tests/ -v` appears
only in build.yml (push/PR to main) and beta-build.yml (push to beta) --
neither fires on this firmware milestone branch, and py32f071.yml has no
pytest step at all. The local run recorded in this phase's SUMMARY is the
only evidence this module's assertions were ever exercised.

Plan 126-08 EXTENDED this module with `test_manifest_names_the_flash_driver`
(C-3's edit-4 assertion) and five sibling functions, once
platform/py32f071/src/config_storage_flash.cpp existed and the tree genuinely
contained `HAL_FLASH_` calls -- an implication-shaped assertion with no
antecedent would have been vacuous before that plan landed. No second module
was created for this extension; it lives here.

**Why `test_manifest_names_the_flash_driver` must prove its own antecedent
(C-3, Pitfall 3):** `platform/py32f071/include/py32f071_hal_conf.h:10` already
sets `HAL_FLASH_MODULE_ENABLED` and `:53` already includes
`py32f071_hal_flash.h`, so every `HAL_FLASH_` call **compiles** -- the failure
this assertion guards against is at **link**, not compile. `scripts/check_cmake_manifest.py`'s
own docstring declares `PY32_SDK_SOURCES` structurally exempt from resolution,
because `PY32_SDK_ROOT` resolves only after a networked `cmake` configure, and
`cmake`, `ninja` and `arm-none-eabi-gcc` are all absent from this environment
-- nothing else here would ever catch a missing flash driver. Without this
assertion proving a real, non-zero count of `HAL_FLASH_` call sites before
checking the manifest, the first sign of the defect would be a gated CI run,
hours after the code was written.

Self-contained path resolution below -- NOT in conftest.py (firestarter/
tests/ has no conftest.py anywhere in the repo, and none of pytest.ini,
pyproject.toml, setup.cfg or tox.ini exist either; a recorded house-rule
pattern decision, not an omission). Stdlib and pytest only.

Every check below is factored into a module-level `_violations_*` helper
taking parsed structures (never raw un-parsed text, except where the check
is itself textual) and returning a list of violations. The positive tests
and the planted-copy RED demonstration (Coverage 13) both call the same
helpers -- a parallel second implementation inside the RED test would prove
nothing about the gate (Phase 124 D-14: "a guard that supplies the answer
it tests is structurally dead"). No blob SHA literal appears anywhere in
this module.

Coverage:
  1. test_config_region_origin_and_length_are_the_recorded_values -- CONFIG's
     ORIGIN and LENGTH parsed from the MEMORY block equal 0x0801E000 and
     8192 (8 KiB).
  2. test_config_page_size_symbol_is_the_reference_manual_figure --
     __config_page_size is PROVIDEd as 256, matching the CFG-02 record.
  3. test_the_two_slots_are_in_different_page_erase_units --
     __config_slot_a_start resolves to ORIGIN(CONFIG) and
     __config_slot_b_start to ORIGIN(CONFIG) + 256, exactly one page apart.
  4. test_config_region_is_sector_aligned -- 0x0801E000 is a multiple of
     8192 -- the arithmetic A6 keeps out of the linker script.
  5. test_config_region_lies_inside_the_physical_part -- CONFIG's start and
     end both lie within 0x08000000 .. 0x08000000 + 128 KiB.
  6. test_app_region_cannot_reach_the_config_region -- FLASH's LENGTH is
     120K and ORIGIN(FLASH) + LENGTH(FLASH) <= ORIGIN(CONFIG).
  7. test_all_four_config_symbols_are_provided -- all four symbol names
     appear in PROVIDE statements.
  8. test_bootloader_seam_is_present_and_zero_length -- accepts either a
     BOOTLOADER region with LENGTH = 0, or the A7 fallback pair of
     PROVIDEd start/size symbols with size 0. At least one shape must
     exist; a non-zero length or size in either shape is a violation.
  9. test_bootloader_seam_carries_its_migration_cost_comment -- the comment
     states that giving the seam a size moves the application origin and is
     a migration rather than a resize.
  10. test_the_linker_script_cites_the_geometry_record -- the leading
      comment names CONFIG-STORAGE.md and the RM identifiers.
  11. test_no_pre_pv32f071_page_or_sector_figure_appears_near_a_config_address
      -- Pitfall 1's warning signs (128, 0x80, 2048, 4096) are absent from
      the MEMORY block and the config-symbol region, each named with the
      wrong source it corresponds to.
  12. test_host_contract_asymmetry_is_recorded -- CONFIG-STORAGE.md records
      FLASH_BASE 0x08000000, the 131072 envelope, and the correct-not-drift
      statement (C-10 / D-12).
  13. test_helper_reports_violations_on_planted_copies -- the RED
      demonstration: six planted mutated copies in tmp_path, each fed to the
      same module-level helpers, each producing a non-empty violation list.
      The real linker script's blob SHA is unchanged before and after.
  14. test_compiler_is_required_not_optional -- the self-enforcing no-skip
      leg.
  15. test_manifest_names_the_flash_driver -- C-3's edit-4 assertion: an
      implication with a PROVEN antecedent. Scans platform/py32f071/src/ for
      any `HAL_FLASH_` call, fails if the scan finds none (the antecedent
      must be real, not assumed), then asserts the manifest names
      py32f071_hal_flash.c. Records the scanned-file count and the
      call-site count in the assertion message.
  16. test_the_flash_glue_uses_only_hal_entry_points -- C-4: the HAL glue TU
      (config_storage_flash.cpp) calls only HAL_FLASH_Unlock, HAL_FLASH_Erase,
      HAL_FLASH_Program and HAL_FLASH_Lock, and contains no direct
      flash-register access (no `FLASH->...`).
  17. test_the_dualslot_core_stays_hal_free -- config_storage_dualslot.cpp's
      include set is exactly its local header plus C standard headers, with
      no HAL call and no platform #error guard, so the host harness can
      compile it directly.
  18. test_pr48_config_cpp_is_absent_from_the_tree -- CFG-07's deletion,
      verified by absence.
  19. test_slot_addresses_come_from_linker_symbols -- the glue TU declares
      the three linker symbols extern and does not duplicate any config
      address as a literal constant.
  20. test_manifest_helper_reports_violations_on_planted_copies -- the RED
      demonstration: a manifest with the flash-driver entry removed (while a
      HAL_FLASH_ call exists), a glue TU with a direct register access, and a
      core TU with a HAL include, each fed to the same module-level helpers
      the positive tests above call, each producing a non-empty violation
      list. No committed file is mutated; the three watched blob SHAs
      (CMakeLists.txt, config_storage_flash.cpp, config_storage_dualslot.cpp)
      are confirmed unchanged before and after.
