Host-side numerical oracle and source-contract scan for
`rurp_read_voltage_mv` (src/boards/rurp_common.cpp) -- DEAD-04's committed
proof that the 32-bit reformulation (this phase) is equivalent to the
64-bit form it replaces, bound to the shipped C so the Python model cannot
drift from the firmware silently.

Requirements: DEAD-03, DEAD-04, DEAD-05
Decisions covered: OQ-1, OQ-3, D-02

Coverage ceiling. `rurp_read_voltage_mv` compiles in no native environment
-- [env:native]'s and [env:native_nodevtools]'s shared `build_src_filter`
admits only `src/proms/`, `boards/rurp_serial_utils.cpp`, `json_parser.c`
and `operation_utils.cpp`, and widening it was measured unavailable
because the translation unit is gated on the three ARDUINO_AVR_* board
macros and its body writes AVR ADC registers. So, in exactly these terms:
`rurp_read_voltage_mv` is proven by a committed host-side numerical oracle
over a stated input grid, bound to the shipped C by a source-contract
scan; no native and no bench coverage exists. This phase creates neither.
The named residual risk, stated and NOT presented as covered: avr-gcc
miscompiling the 32-bit multiply/divide. No artefact of this phase
mitigates that risk; it is mitigated only by that being AVR's
most-exercised code-generation path, and by this phase's change reducing
rather than increasing codegen complexity, since it deletes the 64-bit
path rather than adding one.

The hollow-gate tension, answered rather than dodged.
`tests/test_config_storage_dualslot.py`'s own docstring explicitly rejects
"an independent fake reimplementation of the algorithm living only in
this test", naming it as the exact hollow-gate shape Phases 118 and 124
each had to unwind -- and this module's numerical half IS such a
reimplementation, so a reviewer will raise this. The answer: the
source-contract half below is what converts "a copy behaves" into "the
shipped text is the formula the copy models" -- the three model
constants (_SCALE_NUMERATOR, _GUARD_SUM_MAX, _GUARD_K_MAX) and the five
transcribed constructs are asserted to appear, verbatim or by construct,
in the comment-stripped shipped body, so a change on either side turns
this module red. `test_config_storage_dualslot.py`'s own alternative --
host-compile the real C -- is unavailable here: `src/boards/rurp_common.cpp`
wraps its entire body in a preprocessor test of the three ARDUINO_AVR_*
board macros with an unsupported-board #error fall-through, and the
function's body writes the ADMUX and ADCSRA registers and calls
analogRead, analogReference and rurp_get_config. Forcing a board macro
would drag in AVR register headers and make the register mocking the
thing under test.

Non-claim: a green run of this module proves that two integer formulas
agree over the stated grid, and that the shipped C is textually the
formula this module models. It does not execute AVR code.

Where this runs: CI leg 3 (`pytest tests/ -v`), adding zero AVR bytes,
zero native test cases, and moving no count any gate asserts by exact
equality.
