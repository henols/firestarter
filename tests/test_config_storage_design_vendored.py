Phase 126 Plan 01 -- CFG-01's mechanical gate over
platform/py32f071/CONFIG-STORAGE.md, the in-scope flash-config design
vendored from closed-PR blob 4b1a441, plus a first mechanical check on
CFG-02's flash-geometry record.

Requirements: CFG-01, CFG-02
Decisions covered: D-01, D-13, D-16, D-17, D-18, D-19

This module executes in NO CI leg on this branch: `pytest tests/ -v` runs
only in build.yml (push/PR to main) and beta-build.yml (push to beta) --
neither fires on this firmware milestone branch, and py32f071.yml has no
pytest step at all. The local run recorded in this phase's evidence
artifact is the only evidence this module's assertions were ever
exercised.

Self-contained path resolution below -- NOT in conftest.py (firestarter/
tests/ has no conftest.py anywhere in the repo, and none of pytest.ini,
pyproject.toml, setup.cfg or tox.ini exist either; a recorded house-rule
pattern, not an omission, per tests/test_vpp_seam_manual_on_every_board.py's
own docstring). Stdlib and pytest only -- no third-party import, no
PlatformIO import, nothing under .pio/, because a dependency on
.pio/libdeps/ passes on a warm tree and fails on a clean checkout (the
fail-open shape this milestone has already paid for once, A-7).

All nine test functions below are built on ONE module-level helper,
_find_design_doc_violations(text), so the positive tests and the
planted-violation RED demonstration (Coverage 8) exercise the same
checking code rather than a second, parallel implementation that could
silently drift from what the positive tests actually check.

Coverage:
  1. test_design_doc_cites_the_vendored_blob_by_sha -- the doc contains
     '4b1a441' and names both closed-PR branches and PR numbers.
  2. test_design_doc_marks_every_superseded_module -- all seven
     superseded module identifiers are present AND each appears inside
     the SUPERSEDED section's own span, not merely somewhere in the file.
  3. test_design_doc_records_the_flash_geometry_with_its_citation -- 256
     and 8192 both present, the RM V0.2 section identifiers present, and
     the pinned SDK commit '0ed2f4b4...' present.
  4. test_design_doc_records_config_magic_as_not_vendored -- '0x52555250'
     present, and the sentence marking it a this-milestone rather than
     vendored choice present.
  5. test_design_doc_records_the_d16_amendment -- the amendment section
     exists and cites RM §4.2.3.2.
  6. test_design_doc_refuses_to_call_crc32_a_security_primitive -- the
     explicit not-a-security-primitive statement is present.
  7. test_design_doc_records_the_reserved_map_addresses -- '0x0801E000',
     '0x0801E100', '120K', '8K' and '256' all present.
  8. test_helper_reports_a_violation_on_a_planted_copy -- the RED
     demonstration: a copy of the doc in tmp_path with the blob-SHA
     citation stripped is fed to the same module-level helper the
     positive tests use, and the helper reports a violation naming the
     missing citation. This is what makes the gate non-vacuous (Phases
     118 and 124 each shipped a gate that passed without observing
     anything and had to be unwound).
  9. test_compiler_is_required_not_optional -- the analog's
     self-enforcing no-skip leg, adapted: this module invokes no
     compiler, so the leg asserts only that the module contains no skip
     call and no conditional-skip marker anywhere in its own source.
