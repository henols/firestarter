Phase 126 Plan 05 -- CFG-03's structural gate for the configuration-persistence
storage seam (include/rurp_config_storage.h): exactly two bool-returning
functions with C linkage, includes ordered before the extern "C" wrapper,
never reachable from include/rurp_shield.h, included by exactly the
sanctioned translation units, the four public config declarations still above
the seam, CONFIG_VERSION unchanged, CONFIG_START below the seam, and the
common policy layer carrying no platform conditional.

Requirements: CFG-03
Decisions covered: D-01, D-06, D-07, D-08, D-09

Plan 126-03 landed include/rurp_config_storage.h and proved its AVR behaviour
byte-identical via the CFG-04 regression test (Plan 126-02). Nothing yet
stops a later edit from adding a third seam function, moving a declaration,
dropping the extern "C" wrapper, or adding the one #include line D-09 exists
to forbid -- the include that would make `pio test -e native` collapse from
141 cases / 141 succeeded to 17 suites / 0 succeeded (measured, Phase 125
C-1). This module turns each of those into an exit code, locally, before the
gated ARM CI run is the only thing that would catch them.

This module executes in NO CI leg on this branch: `pytest tests/` runs only
in build.yml (push/PR to main) and beta-build.yml (push to beta);
py32f071.yml has no pytest step at all. The local run recorded in this
phase's SUMMARY is the only evidence this module's assertions were ever
exercised.

This module invokes no compiler -- every assertion below is a textual gate
over committed source, following tests/test_vpp_seam_manual_on_every_board.py
and tests/test_config_storage_eeprom_regression.py's plain read_text() idiom,
deliberately not parsed into a structure.

Self-contained path resolution below -- NOT in conftest.py (firestarter/tests/
has no conftest.py anywhere in the repo, and none of pytest.ini,
pyproject.toml, setup.cfg or tox.ini exist either; a recorded house-rule
pattern decision, not an omission). Stdlib and pytest only.

Every check below is factored into a module-level helper taking a path's text
(or, for the two census checks, a filesystem tree) and returning a list of
violations, so the positive tests and the planted-copy RED demonstration
(Coverage 9) exercise the identical code path -- a parallel second
implementation inside the RED test would prove nothing about the gate
(Phase 124 D-14: "a guard that supplies the answer it tests is structurally
dead"). No blob SHA literal appears anywhere in this module: a committed gate
pinning a shared header by hash would break the first time a later milestone
legitimately edits it (the D-09 blob pin for include/rurp_shield.h is a
plan-level record instead, re-executed by 126-NONREGRESSION.md). The one
blob-SHA comparison this module does make (Coverage 9) is entirely
self-referential -- before vs. after this module's own mutation demo, never
against a hardcoded historical value.

Coverage:
  1. test_seam_header_declares_exactly_two_functions -- D-06: the declaration
     census over include/rurp_config_storage.h finds exactly the two D-06
     bool prototypes and nothing else (no enum, no typedef, no non-guard
     object-like macro).
  2. test_seam_header_has_c_linkage_with_includes_outside_the_wrapper -- C-11
     / D-06: the extern "C" wrapper exists, both declarations lie inside it,
     and <stdbool.h>/<stddef.h> are included strictly before it opens -- the
     only local detector for a mismatch that would otherwise surface solely
     as an ARM link failure (arm-none-eabi-gcc is absent here).
  3. test_seam_header_is_not_included_by_rurp_shield_h -- D-09: a
     repo-bounded transitive reachability walk from include/rurp_shield.h
     never reaches the seam header, and the walk visits at least one header
     (so it cannot pass by visiting nothing).
  4. test_seam_header_includers_are_exactly_the_sanctioned_set -- D-09: the
     includer census over src/, include/, platform/, test/ and lib/ asserts
     every hit is sanctioned, every sanctioned path that exists in the tree
     is a hit, and the hit count is at least 2 -- stable both before and
     after Plan 126-08 lands the third includer.
  5. test_public_config_declarations_stay_in_rurp_shield_h -- D-07: all four
     of rurp_get_config, rurp_load_config, rurp_save_config and
     rurp_validate_config stay declared in include/rurp_shield.h and are
     absent from the seam header.
  6. test_config_version_literal_is_unchanged -- D-07: CONFIG_VERSION in
     include/rurp_shield.h is still the literal "VER06".
  7. test_config_start_lives_below_the_seam -- D-07: CONFIG_START is defined
     as 48 in the AVR backend translation unit and absent from the common
     policy layer.
  8. test_policy_layer_has_no_platform_conditional -- D-08: the common
     policy layer (src/rurp_config_utils.cpp) contains no preprocessor
     conditional, so "per-platform backend" is structurally true rather than
     true only because the file says so.
  9. test_helper_reports_violations_on_planted_copies -- the RED
     demonstration: four independently planted mutations (a third
     declaration; includes moved inside the extern "C" block; a
     rurp_shield.h copy carrying the forbidden include; an unsanctioned
     includer), each built in tmp_path and fed to the same module-level
     helper the corresponding positive test calls, each producing a
     non-empty violation list. Confirms no committed file was touched by
     re-hashing include/rurp_config_storage.h, include/rurp_shield.h and
     src/rurp_config_utils.cpp before and after.
 10. test_module_has_no_pio_libdeps_dependency -- C-12: this module's own
     text contains no path under the gitignored PlatformIO build-artifacts
     directory.
 11. test_compiler_is_required_not_optional -- adapted from the analog's
     self-enforcing no-skip leg (test_vpp_seam_manual_on_every_board.py:
     447-468, copied verbatim including its concatenation trick): this
     module invokes no compiler, so the leg asserts only that no skip call
     or conditional-skip marker appears anywhere in this module's own text.
