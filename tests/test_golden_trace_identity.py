Phase 124 Plan 03 — MERGE-06's per-array golden-trace identity pin.

Requirements: MERGE-06

Defect class this closes: the 141-case/17-suite `pio test -e native` count
that MERGE-06's other checks rely on as "the two consuming suites pass" is
invariant under an array being deleted TOGETHER with the `TEST_ASSERT` calls
that consumed it -- both the array and its assertions vanish, so the count
stays 141/17 and the suite still reports green. A count assertion cannot see
that class of change. This module adds the two checks RESEARCH §MERGE-06
records as still missing: whole-file blob identity, and a per-array
name + entry-count inventory, independently re-parsed from the file rather
than trusted from any prior record (including this module's own committed
JSON) -- the point of an inventory pin is that the file and the recorded
expectation are read by two separate mechanisms and compared, so a change to
either alone is visible.

Coverage:
  1. test_blob_sha_matches_the_recorded_inventory -- `git rev-parse
     HEAD:test/native/avr/_shared/sdp_expected.h` equals `meta.blob_sha` in
     the committed inventory JSON.
  2. test_array_names_match_the_recorded_inventory -- the ordered list of
     array names parsed from the live file equals the ordered list of names
     in the JSON.
  3. test_array_entry_counts_match_the_recorded_inventory -- per-array entry
     counts match, positionally; the assertion message names the FIRST
     diverging array and both counts (never a bare "lists differ"), mirroring
     sdp_expected.h's own sdp_first_divergence discipline.
  4. test_inventory_is_non_vacuous -- the JSON records at least 9 arrays and
     every recorded `entries` is >= 1; an empty or truncated inventory must
     FAIL, not silently pass.
  5. test_consuming_suites_still_include_the_fixture -- both
     test/native/avr/test_sdp_harness/test_sdp_harness.cpp and
     test/native/avr/test_eeprom28c_sdp/test_eeprom28c_sdp.cpp still contain
     the literal `_shared/sdp_expected.h` include. This is the link that
     makes the fixture load-bearing: if both consumers stopped including it,
     the blob could stay byte-identical while nothing exercised it.
  6. test_git_is_required_not_optional -- this module's own source contains
     no runtime skip-bypass call and no skip-marker decorator anywhere: the
     fail-closed contract (a missing `git` binary must FAIL the suite, never
     silently skip it) is self-enforcing. (The exact two patterns this test
     scans for are named in its own docstring below, not repeated here, so
     this module-level list stays a plain description rather than a second
     copy of the literal patterns.)

This module never imports check_*.py machinery: it is a standalone pytest
module asserting directly against the committed inventory JSON and the live
firmware tree via `git` subprocess calls (list-form argv, invoked directly
rather than through a shell) and plain file reads. `_parse_arrays()`
deliberately duplicates the derivation Plan 124-03's Task 1 used to author
the JSON, rather than importing a shared helper -- the inventory and the
file are meant to be compared by two INDEPENDENT readings, not by one
parser trusting its own prior output.

Self-contained path resolution below -- NOT in conftest.py (firestarter/
tests/ has no conftest.py anywhere in the repo; a recorded house-rule pattern
decision per test_update_version.py's own comment, not an omission).
Stdlib and pytest only.
