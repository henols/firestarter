Phase 129 Plan 01 (fail-closed half) + Plan 02 (parity half) -- D-03's
fail-closed sync gate over the two copies of the v1.23 flash-path and PCB
requirements record.

Requirements: PCB-01, PCB-02, PCB-03, PCB-04, PCB-05 (mechanical
content-gate slice only -- this module does NOT close any of them, and no
requirement is marked complete in REQUIREMENTS.md from this plan).

Decisions covered: D-01, D-03, D-04, D-11, D-16, D-17

**The shared-section contract.** The two copies are
`.planning/v1.23-FLASH-PATH-DECISION.md` in the meta repo (authoritative)
and `platform/py32f071/FLASH-PATH-AND-PCB.md` in this repo (subset). Five
stable keys name the sections both copies must carry, each appearing as a
suffix on a `## ` heading line in both copies: `S1` three-tier flash path
(`[SHARED:S1]`), `S2` PCB checklist (`[SHARED:S2]`), `S3` flash budget
(`[SHARED:S3]`), `S4` USB VID/PID (`[SHARED:S4]`), `S5` socket-empty
instruction (`[SHARED:S5]`). Only the **body** below each heading is
compared -- the meta copy numbers its headings and the subset does not, so
heading text itself is never part of the comparison. The same five keys are
named in `firestarter/CLAUDE.md` so the human instruction and the machine
gate cannot drift apart (v1.7 precedent).

**CI coverage, stated honestly.** This module executes in NO CI leg on this branch:
`pytest tests/ -v` runs only in `build.yml` (push/PR to `main`) and
`beta-build.yml` (push to `beta`) -- neither fires on this firmware
milestone branch, and `py32f071.yml` has no pytest step at all. The local
run recorded in this phase's evidence artifact is the only evidence this
module's assertions were ever exercised. Never imply CI coverage.

**Single-helper rule.** Every test -- positive legs and planted-violation
legs alike -- goes through the one module-level `_extract_shared_section` /
`_shared_sections` pair, so the RED demonstrations exercise the same
checking code the positive legs do. Two parallel implementations drift and
the RED then proves nothing.

**The RED-first disposition.** This module was committed before either
record existed. Plan 02's parity legs were therefore RED-by-construction on
arrival, and the RED took the form of `MissingScanTargetError` -- the
hard-failure half of the split -- not a skip.

**No conftest.py.** This module resolves its own paths, the same
`_HERE`-relative idiom every other module in this directory uses. No
`conftest.py`, `pytest.ini`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg` or `tox.ini`
exists anywhere in this repository -- a recorded house rule, not an
omission.

Coverage (this plan's fail-closed half only -- Plan 02 adds the parity and
content class, `TestFlashPathRecordSync`, to this same module):
  1. test_absent_meta_root_skip_is_auditable_not_silent -- F-14 mode 3.
  2. test_absent_meta_claim_can_never_be_false -- the census assertion: a
     skip claiming absence while the marker exists must be impossible.
  3. test_present_root_with_missing_target_raises_not_skips -- F-14 mode
     3's hard half: a missing scan target under a present repo raises.
  4. test_marker_name_is_not_overridable -- the seam overrides the root
     only, never the marker name.
  5. test_empty_extraction_is_not_a_vacuous_pass -- F-14 mode 2.
  6. test_renamed_marker_yields_a_refusal_not_a_guess -- F-14 mode 4.
  7. test_duplicate_marker_refuses_to_guess -- a parser that refuses to
     guess between two candidates.
  8. test_planted_divergence_in_synthetic_copies_is_detected -- F-14 mode
     1.
  9. test_dirty_tree_is_detected -- F-14 mode 5.
  10. test_git_binary_is_required_not_optional.

Plan 02's parity and content class, `TestFlashPathRecordSync` (12 test
functions, 31 collected legs -- RED by construction on arrival, since
neither record exists yet):
  11. test_meta_extract_is_non_vacuous -- parametrized over _SHARED_KEYS (5
      legs).
  12. test_fw_extract_is_non_vacuous -- parametrized over _SHARED_KEYS (5
      legs).
  13. test_shared_sections_match -- parametrized over _SHARED_KEYS (5 legs).
  14. test_three_tiers_and_non_retirement -- parametrized over
      ("meta", "fw") (2 legs). PCB-01.
  15. test_pcb_checklist_rows_are_wellformed -- parametrized over
      ("meta", "fw") (2 legs). PCB-02.
  16. test_flash_budget_cites_reserved_map -- parametrized over
      ("meta", "fw") (2 legs). PCB-03.
  17. test_bootloader_figure_carries_its_cost -- parametrized over
      ("meta", "fw") (2 legs). D-10's proximity gate.
  18. test_vid_pid_decision_and_ship_gate -- parametrized over
      ("meta", "fw") (2 legs). PCB-04.
  19. test_socket_empty_instruction_present -- parametrized over
      ("meta", "fw", "readme") (3 legs). PCB-05.
  20. test_linker_comment_cross_references_record (1 leg). D-11 / C-1.
  21. test_seed_status_is_no_longer_dormant (1 leg). D-17 / D-18.
  22. test_planted_mutation_of_the_real_subset_is_detected (1 leg). F-14
      mode 1 against the real artifact.

Expected-RED ledger on arrival. All 31 legs added by Plan 02 are RED when
this module is committed -- neither `.planning/v1.23-FLASH-PATH-DECISION.md`
nor `platform/py32f071/FLASH-PATH-AND-PCB.md` exists yet. The RED for every
`meta`-side leg is `MissingScanTargetError` (never a skip): `_meta_doc()`
routes through `meta_presence.meta_path()`, which raises under a present
meta repo with a missing target. The RED for every `fw`-side and `readme`
leg is a plain `AssertionError` from the `.exists()` guard in
`_fw_doc_text()` / `_readme_text()`, or (once the firmware subset exists) a
content `AssertionError` from a needle/literal miss. Discharging plan per
group: `129-03` discharges S1 (test 14); `129-04` discharges S2 and S3
(tests 15, 16, 17); `129-05` discharges S4 and S5 (tests 18, 19); `129-06`
discharges every `fw` and `readme` parametrization not already covered, all
five `test_shared_sections_match` legs (test 13) and the planted-mutation
leg (test 22); `129-07` discharges the linker leg (test 20); `129-08`
discharges the seed leg (test 21). Tests 11 and 12 (the per-copy
non-vacuity legs) are discharged incrementally as each record's content
lands.
