Phase 126 Plan 10 -- CFG-07's two-halved gate: the configuration schema pinned
as a field list and a version literal, and PR #48's deleted
platform/py32f071/src/config.cpp pinned by absence from the tree.

Requirements: CFG-07
Decisions covered: D-01, D-07, D-17

Criterion 5 asks for two separate things, both load-bearing on their own:
  (a) rurp_configuration_t's four fields, in order, and CONFIG_VERSION's
      literal, unchanged;
  (b) platform/py32f071/src/config.cpp verified absent from the tree.
Neither half is provable by a diff. A diff can be satisfied on a wrong path
(124-VERIFICATION.md recorded exactly that shape passing vacuously), and a
schema diff shows only that something moved, not that a field was added, a
field was reordered, or a fifth member appeared. This module turns both halves
into path/text assertions that either hold or produce an exit code.

WHAT THE ABSENCE ASSERTION PROTECTS:
platform/py32f071/src/config.cpp (Plan 126-08, PR #48) was a second, drifted
copy of the common policy, with four recorded drift points: a private static
`configuration` in an unnamed namespace instead of the shared `rurp_config`
global; a second `rurp_validate_config` whose condition added `|| r2 == 0`
and whose body opened with a `memset`, neither of which the common policy
has; no write-back call at all inside its `rurp_load_config` (a virgin
part's defaults were computed but never persisted); and a `rurp_save_config`
that validated, assigned to the private static, and persisted nothing at
all -- a function whose name promised persistence and delivered none.
Criterion 5 asks for the deletion to be verified by absence from the tree,
which a diff cannot do -- a path-scoped diff can pass on a wrong path, the
shape 124-VERIFICATION.md recorded live. That drift record now exists only
in 126-08-SUMMARY.md; this module's docstring and its
test_the_four_public_functions_are_defined_exactly_once assertion are what
keep a reappearance of any of those four functions under platform/ an exit
code rather than something a reviewer has to notice.

WHY THE SCHEMA PIN OUTLIVES THIS PHASE:
rurp_configuration_t is precisely the struct the closed calibration PR's
`768580f` adds fields to BEFORE its CONFIG_VERSION bump -- a silent layout
change while the version string still reads "VER06". That is strictly worse
than a visible version bump, because every board already storing a record
would misparse the new layout with no migration signal at all. A future
cherry-pick of that shape is exactly what this gate exists to catch, which is
why the field list and the version literal are asserted together, not
separately.

This module executes in NO CI leg on this branch: `pytest tests/` runs only
in build.yml (push/PR to main) and beta-build.yml (push to beta); py32f071.yml
has no pytest step at all. The local run recorded in this phase's SUMMARY is
the only evidence this module's assertions were ever exercised.

This module invokes no compiler -- every assertion below is a textual gate
over committed source, following tests/test_vpp_seam_manual_on_every_board.py
and tests/test_config_storage_seam_shape.py's plain read_text() idiom,
deliberately not parsed into a structure.

Self-contained path resolution below -- NOT in conftest.py (firestarter/tests/
has no conftest.py anywhere in the repo, and none of pytest.ini,
pyproject.toml, setup.cfg or tox.ini exist either; a recorded house-rule
pattern decision, not an omission). Stdlib and pytest only.

Every check below is factored into a module-level helper taking text (or, for
the two filesystem-tree checks, a repo root) and returning a list of
violations, so the positive tests and the planted-copy RED demonstrations
exercise the identical code path -- a parallel second implementation inside a
RED test would prove nothing about the gate (Phase 124 D-14: "a guard that
supplies the answer it tests is structurally dead"). No blob SHA literal
appears anywhere in this module: a committed gate pinning a shared header by
hash would break the first time a later milestone legitimately edits it --
the blob-SHA pins for include/rurp_types.h and include/rurp_shield.h are a
plan-level record instead (this plan's SUMMARY), re-executed by
126-NONREGRESSION.md. The one blob-SHA comparison this module does make (the
planted-copy demonstrations below) is entirely self-referential -- before vs.
after this module's own mutation demos, never against a hardcoded historical
value.

VALIDATION CEILING: this module reads source text and compiles nothing. It
makes no build or runtime claim; see .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md's "Validation
Ceiling" section for the claims this phase is not permitted to make.

Coverage:
  1. test_rurp_configuration_t_has_exactly_the_four_pinned_fields -- the
     struct's member list is exactly version (char[6]), r1 (long), r2 (long),
     hardware_revision (uint8_t), in that order, with no fifth member and no
     size or offset literal.
  2. test_config_version_literal_is_ver06 -- CONFIG_VERSION in
     include/rurp_shield.h is still the literal "VER06".
  3. test_default_resistance_values_are_unchanged -- VALUE_R1 is 270000 and
     VALUE_R2 is 44000 -- rurp_validate_config's write-back writes both, so a
     silent change would alter every defaulting board's stored record with no
     version signal.
  4. test_stored_configuration_embeds_the_struct_whole -- D-17: the vendored
     StoredConfiguration wrapper embeds rurp_configuration_t as a single named
     member (making "schema unchanged" structural rather than merely
     asserted), and the wrapper's own `version` member is a uint16_t distinct
     from the char[6] CONFIG_VERSION literal living inside the embedded
     struct.
  5. test_pr48_config_cpp_is_absent_from_the_tree -- Criterion 5's
     verified-by-absence: a path-existence check, never a diff.
  6. test_the_four_public_functions_are_defined_exactly_once -- each of
     rurp_get_config, rurp_load_config, rurp_save_config and
     rurp_validate_config has exactly one definition anywhere under src/,
     platform/ or lib/, that one definition lives in
     src/rurp_config_utils.cpp, and none lives anywhere under platform/ --
     the standing guard against PR #48's drift reappearing.
  7. test_the_four_public_functions_are_declared_in_rurp_shield_h -- all four
     declarations are present there.
  8. test_the_seven_consumers_call_only_the_public_api -- C-14's consumer
     census. CORRECTION (Rule 1): 126-RESEARCH.md's C-14 heading and every
     prose reference to it call this "the seven consumers", but its own
     verified enumeration -- reproduced in this plan's read_first block --
     lists NINE distinct (file, line) call sites across five files:
     src/firestarter.cpp:41,104,110 (Phase 143 Plan 03 shifted these three by
     +1 -- an #include "eprom_budget.h" line added above every one of them;
     re-verified, not re-derived, since the census is a hand-pinned tuple,
     not a golden with a re-derivation script); src/boards/rurp_common.cpp:53;
     include/rurp_hw_rev_utils.h:95,101; src/hardware_operations.cpp:107,119;
     platform/py32f071/src/py32f071_rurp_shield.cpp:297. This module asserts
     the verified, enumerable count (nine), not the mislabeled prose count
     (seven) -- "verified facts win" is this phase's own stated read-order
     precedence, and the same shape as Phase 121's corrected
     CONTEXT/ROADMAP miscounts. The function keeps its plan-specified name.
  9. test_helper_reports_violations_on_planted_copies -- the RED
     demonstration: six independently planted mutations, each built as a real
     file in tmp_path (never a committed file) and fed to the same
     module-level helper the corresponding positive test calls, each
     producing a non-empty violation list. Confirms no committed file was
     mutated by re-hashing include/rurp_types.h, include/rurp_shield.h and
     src/rurp_config_utils.cpp before and after each case.
 10. test_absence_check_fires_when_config_cpp_is_planted -- a dedicated
     second RED demonstration for Coverage 5 specifically (an absence
     assertion is the easiest kind to write vacuously): a scratch
     platform/py32f071/src/config.cpp is planted under tmp_path and the same
     absence helper the positive test calls is shown to fire on it.
 11. test_module_has_no_pio_libdeps_dependency -- C-12: this module's own
     text contains no path under the gitignored PlatformIO build-artifacts
     directory.
 12. test_no_skip_call_or_conditional_skip_marker_present -- adapted from the
     analog's self-enforcing no-skip leg
     (test_vpp_seam_manual_on_every_board.py:447-468), copied verbatim
     including its concatenation trick: this module invokes no compiler, so
     the leg asserts only that no skip call or conditional-skip marker
     appears anywhere in this module's own text.
