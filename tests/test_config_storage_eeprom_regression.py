Phase 126 Plan 02 -- CFG-04's AVR regression test, authored against the
UNTOUCHED, pre-refactor `src/rurp_config_utils.cpp` (blob
6705fd46e07a2d359d161dc2e7728cb4e45f89c7 at the time this module was written).

Requirements: CFG-04
Decisions covered: D-01, D-04, D-06, D-07, D-08

This module is authored against the pre-refactor policy file ON PURPOSE. Its
own blob SHA is recorded in this phase's SUMMARY.md the moment it goes green,
so that Plan 126-03 -- which performs the CFG-03/D-07/D-08 split into a common
policy layer plus a per-platform two-function backend -- can re-hash exactly
that recorded SHA as its primary proof that the file did not change underneath
the split. A test written AFTER the refactor could only prove the new code is
self-consistent; it could never have observed the *before* state this module
is the sole witness to. This is D-04's two-commit discharge of ROADMAP
Criterion 3 ("behaviour identical to the pre-refactor code -- proven by an
empty git diff on the test file itself"): write and prove this module here
(commit 1, this plan); land the split later (commit 2, Plan 126-03); the proof
is that the recorded blob SHA re-hashes identical and this module is still
green against the post-refactor tree. A path-scoped `git diff --stat` is
corroboration only, never the primary proof -- see this phase's evidence
ledger for why (124-VERIFICATION.md records a live finding where exactly that
pipeline reported "(empty)" while a real change's trailer survived the grep).

This module executes in NO CI leg on this branch: `pytest tests/` runs only in
build.yml (push/PR to main) and beta-build.yml (push to beta); py32f071.yml
has no pytest step. The local run recorded in this phase's evidence artifact
is the only evidence this module's assertions were ever exercised.

Self-contained path resolution below -- NOT in conftest.py (firestarter/tests/
has no conftest.py anywhere in the repo, and none of pytest.ini,
pyproject.toml, setup.cfg or tox.ini exist either; a recorded house-rule
pattern decision, not an omission). Stdlib and pytest only -- no path under
the gitignored PlatformIO build-artifacts directory may appear anywhere in
this module (C-12): ArduinoFake ships an EEPROM.h, but only under that
gitignored per-env libdeps directory, a build artifact that exists solely
after a native build. Depending on it would make this module pass on a warm
tree and fail on a clean checkout, so the fake EEPROM.h below is
hand-written fresh into tmp_path on every call instead.

Coverage:
  1. test_pre_refactor_tu_compiles_and_runs_with_zero_warnings -- compiles
     and runs the resolved pre-refactor source(s) against the hand-written
     fake EEPROM.h, asserting a clean compile, zero bytes of -Wall -Wextra
     warning output, and a clean run.
  2. test_load_config_get_access_at_config_start_with_sizeof_length -- CFG-04:
     rurp_load_config() produces exactly one recorded get access, at index
     48, with a length equal to sizeof(rurp_configuration_t) as the compiled
     binary itself reports it -- never a Python integer literal (C-6).
  3. test_save_config_put_access_at_config_start_with_sizeof_length -- CFG-04:
     rurp_save_config() produces exactly one recorded put access, at index
     48, with the same symbolic length.
  4. test_validate_config_write_back_produces_put_on_version_mismatch --
     D-14's write-back at rurp_config_utils.cpp:38: rurp_validate_config() on
     a struct whose version does not match CONFIG_VERSION writes the
     defaults back and triggers exactly one put, at index 48.
  5. test_non_vacuity_source_resolved_and_access_recorded -- the two-way
     Discretion-default check: at least one candidate source path resolved
     AND rurp_load_config() recorded at least one access.
  6. test_module_references_no_pio_build_artifact_path -- C-12: this module's
     own text contains no reference to the gitignored PlatformIO
     build-artifacts path.
  7. test_compiler_is_required_not_optional -- this module's own source
     contains no skip decorator and no skip call, so the fail-closed
     contract in _resolve_compiler is self-enforcing and cannot be silently
     bypassed by a future edit (copied verbatim from
     tests/test_vpp_seam_manual_on_every_board.py:447-468).

    least one access. Deliberately scoped to the load phase alone rather
    than a sum across all three phases: the driver seeds BOTH the fake's
    backing storage and the live global config with matching data, so an
    unmutated rurp_load_config() records exactly one get and a mutation
    that removes the get call leaves the load phase's list genuinely
    EMPTY (the seeded global already matches, so the internal validate
    call has nothing to write back) -- rather than being masked by an
    indirect write-back put, which is what would happen were this scoped
    to a sum across all phases (the save and validate phases run their
    own, unrelated calls regardless of what this phase's mutation does).

    exit-code-only test would report a no-op harness as green."""
