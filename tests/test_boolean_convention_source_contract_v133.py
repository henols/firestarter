Phase 156 Plan 06 -- pins the boolean-convention flip Plan 05 landed in
src/operation_utils.cpp and src/eprom_operations.cpp with a committed,
non-vacuous source-scan gate.

Requirements: DEDUP-04

Defect class this closes: src/eprom_operations.cpp -- the nine eprom_*
command wrappers whose leading `!` Plan 05 removed -- compiles in NO
native environment. [env:native] and [env:native_nodevtools] both share
a build_src_filter that names src/proms/, two board-support translation
units, json_parser.c and src/operation_utils.cpp explicitly, and excludes
every other top-level src/*.cpp file by omission -- eprom_operations.cpp
among them. src/operation_utils.cpp (the six flipped engine return sites)
IS in that filter and is covered by Cases 24 and 25 of
test_eeprom28c_sdp.cpp; the nine wrapper call sites have no native and no
bench coverage at all -- only this source contract and Plan 05's
size-identity build. This module is a SOURCE CONTRACT: it proves the
shipped text says what Plan 05 claims, never what the compiled code does
at runtime.

Coverage:
  1. test_wrapper_negated_return_is_absent -- zero occurrences of the
     concatenation-built negated-call needle (_NEEDLE_INVERTED_CALL) in
     the comment-and-literal-stripped wrapper file. Checked as a plain
     substring count, not a word-boundary identifier match: the needle is
     a PREFIX of two larger identifiers, never a standalone word, so a
     \\b-wrapped search would never fire and would pass vacuously
     forever -- see _assert_identifier_absent's own docstring for why
     that helper is deliberately NOT used for this leg.
  2. test_engine_retains_exactly_one_negated_call -- the engine file
     contains EXACTLY ONE surviving negated call inside a return
     statement, and that call is the MAIN-phase callback delegation --
     Plan 05's honest nine-to-one reduction, not an elimination, because
     the callback argument (_process_incoming_data / _process_outgoing_data
     in eprom_operations.cpp) keeps its own opposite convention. A count
     of zero here would mean the surviving negation was wrongly removed;
     a count above one would mean a NEW negation crept in.
  3. test_the_nine_forwarding_calls_are_present -- the positive
     counterpart to Coverage 1: op_execute_stateful_operation and
     op_execute_simple_operation, each reached via a bare `return`,
     together occur exactly _EXPECTED_FORWARD_TOTAL (9) times in the
     comment-and-literal-stripped wrapper file. A deleted, emptied or
     truncated wrapper file satisfies Coverage 1 vacuously; this leg is
     what catches that.
  4. test_the_two_early_return_refusal_literals_survive -- eprom_erase's
     FLAG_CAN_ERASE refusal and eprom_check_chip_id's zero-chip-id
     refusal each still return the literal `true` exactly once, inside
     their own function body -- both are correct under both conventions,
     and a careless mechanical substitution over the whole file is the
     one mistake most likely to flip either of them by accident.
     Asserted on the enclosing function name and the returned literal,
     never on a line number -- Phases 157 and 158 move this file again.
  5. test_scan_targets_are_non_vacuous -- both default scan targets
     exist, are non-empty, resolve inside this repository, and their
     comment-and-literal-stripped text is non-empty.
  6. test_this_module_cannot_be_silently_skipped -- this module's own
     source contains no skip-bypass call, no skip-marker decorator and no
     dependency-skip call anywhere.
  7. test_own_needles_do_not_appear_verbatim_in_this_module -- the
     concatenation-built needles above appear nowhere verbatim in this
     module's own source, so this gate cannot match itself.

Literal-stripping decision (re-confirmed, not copied from the sibling).
test_write_path_source_contract_v131.py asserts its own two scan targets,
src/proms/eprom.cpp and src/proms/memory.cpp, contain no string or
character literal outside a comment or an #include, and treats that
finding as the reason a comment-only stripper suffices there. That
finding does NOT carry over to this module's own two targets unchecked.
src/eprom_operations.cpp was confirmed clean this session (its only
quoted text sits inside `//` comments and `#include` lines).
src/operation_utils.cpp is NOT clean: op_get_message() (its serial
message-framing parser) contains four character literals outside any
comment ('O', 'K', 'D', '#') and one string literal outside any comment
(the "DONE" text passed to PSTR()). None of those five literals contains
any substring this module searches for, so none of them could produce a
false positive under a comment-only stripper on their own -- but rather
than argue that case by case, this module instead borrows
test_protocol_branch_inventory.py's own comment-and-literal stripper
(comments AND the contents of every quoted literal are both replaced with
same-shape whitespace) and applies it uniformly to BOTH scan targets, so
the literal-safety property holds by construction rather than by one-off
inspection.

Environment seams: (this repository has no central environment-variable
inventory -- this docstring is the only place a reader can discover them)
  - FIRESTARTER_BOOLEAN_CONVENTION_SCAN_SOURCE -- overrides the scanned
    src/eprom_operations.cpp path ONLY. src/operation_utils.cpp has no
    override, following the sibling gate's own precedent (its
    src/proms/memory.cpp has none either) -- the engine file is a fixed
    site named by Plan 05's own record. Binds at IMPORT time (the
    module-level Path(os.environ.get(...)) expression below), so a
    planted-violation run that exercises this seam must set it in a CHILD
    PROCESS environment before this module is imported, never via a
    post-import monkeypatch. Coverage 2, 5 (the engine half), 6 and 7
    deliberately never read it: Coverage 2 always reads the fixed engine
    path; Coverage 5 recomputes the default targets directly from the
    repository root without ever reading os.environ; Coverage 6 and 7
    read only this module's own source. A stray seam value left set after
    a planted run cannot make any of these four pass vacuously -- at
    worst it makes Coverage 1, 3 or 4 fail loudly (a FileNotFoundError
    surfaces from Path.read_text() when the overridden path does not
    exist).

CI framing, stated honestly: `pytest tests/ -v` appears in
.github/workflows/build.yml:161 and .github/workflows/beta-build.yml:134,
so this module -- like every other file under tests/ -- WILL run in CI
once this branch reaches `main` or `beta`. Neither workflow triggers on
this milestone branch itself, so today this module lands in a CI leg
without being exercised by CI on this branch.

This module is a standalone pytest module: it is not named check_*.py
(that glob belongs to a different, paired convention this module does not
need), it adds no shared pytest configuration or fixture-registration
file, and it imports nothing beyond the Python standard library. It never
imports, parametrizes against, or edits any pre-existing gate module; the
scanning logic below is its own independent re-derivation of this plan's
own gate specification.
