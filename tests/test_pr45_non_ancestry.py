Phase 125 Plan 03 -- ROADMAP Criterion 1's exit-code-producing proof that no
commit from PR #45 (feature/common-vpp-calibration, closed) is an ancestor of
this firmware integration branch, and that the two new VPP seam files are not
copies of PR #45's blobs.

Requirements: VPP-01
Decisions covered: the Criterion-1 discretion default (a scripted check
producing an exit code, never a prose assertion), plus D-09/D-10 (the API
surface decisions that make content divergence from PR #45 substantial).

Defect class this replaces. ROADMAP Criterion 1's own named mechanism
(`git log --all --grep`/SHA lookup) is wrong in two independent ways, both
measured rather than assumed:

  1. `--grep` searches commit MESSAGES, not commit objects. `git log --all
     --grep=<sha> --oneline` returns zero rows today, and would still return
     zero rows after a cherry-pick whose message was rewritten -- which is
     precisely the evasion Criterion 1 exists to catch. A gate built on it
     passes vacuously forever.
  2. Any reachability question asked against the WHOLE object graph
     (`--all`) gets the wrong answer, because
     origin/feature/common-vpp-calibration is a fetched local
     remote-tracking ref: research measured all ten of PR #45's commits
     reachable that way, and none of them reachable from HEAD. Every
     reachability question in this module therefore names HEAD as its
     scope, never `--all`.

This module asserts directly against the live tree via `git` subprocess
calls, invoked in list form without a shell -- it imports no check_*.py
machinery.

Self-contained path resolution below -- NOT in conftest.py (firestarter/
tests/ has no conftest.py anywhere in the repo, and none of pytest.ini,
pyproject.toml, setup.cfg or tox.ini exist either; a recorded house-rule
pattern decision, not an omission). Stdlib and pytest only.

Coverage:
  1. test_pr45_commit_list_is_never_vacuous -- before any ancestry question
     is asked anywhere in this module: the module-level commit tuple has
     exactly ten entries, the ten entries are distinct, and each entry's
     commit object resolves locally (`git cat-file -e <sha>^{commit}` exits
     0). A non-zero exit here is a TOOL-ERROR class, never read as "not an
     ancestor" -- research recorded this as a real fresh-clone hazard: the
     objects resolve here only because
     origin/feature/common-vpp-calibration is fetched.
  2. test_no_pr45_commit_is_an_ancestor_of_head -- for each of the ten,
     `git merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> HEAD` is classified into exactly
     three buckets: exit 0 means the commit IS an ancestor (collected as a
     violation), exit 1 means clean, any other exit is a loud tool-error
     failure quoting the captured stderr. The number of commits actually
     examined is asserted to equal ten, so a loop that silently skipped
     entries cannot pass; the collected violation list is asserted empty,
     naming every offending commit on failure.
  3. test_seam_files_diverge_from_pr45_blobs -- the two new seam files'
     live worktree blob hashes (`git hash-object <path>`) are asserted NOT
     EQUAL to PR #45's corresponding recorded blob SHAs. Ancestry (coverage
     2) catches a cherry-pick; this leg catches a copy-paste that left no
     commit behind. Also records RESEARCH C-18's finding: PR #45's
     768580f adds the calibration fields to rurp_configuration_t BEFORE the
     PR's own CONFIG_VERSION bump (05f4a77), so cherry-picking 768580f alone
     would change the struct layout while the version string stayed
     literally "VER06" -- a silent schema change with no migration signal,
     strictly worse than the visible bump the record already warns about.
     That is the failure mode a well-meaning "just take the types" shortcut
     would produce, and it is why the answer is take nothing.
  4. test_git_is_required_not_optional -- combines two protections: (a) the
     fail-closed `git` resolver is exercised directly and asserted non-None;
     (b) this module's own source is scanned to assert neither pytest skip
     construct appears anywhere in it, keeping the fail-closed contract from
     being edited away. A skip that reports success at exit 0 is the
     absence-proxy failure class this milestone's Phase 123 removed.

This module's own source is scanned by coverage 4's needle search, which is
built by string concatenation rather than written verbatim precisely so this
scan does not trip on its own assertion text -- see that test's docstring for
what it searches for, not repeated here as a second literal copy.
