Phase 125 Plan 02 -- VPP-02's parametrized compile-and-run proof that the VPP
control seam refuses (returns MANUAL_ADJUSTMENT_REQUIRED) on every board
macro-set this branch supports.

Requirements: VPP-02
Decisions covered: D-01, D-02, D-03, D-04, D-05, D-06, D-07, D-08

RURP_HAS_VPP_DAC has exactly two consumers: the header's `#if !defined(...)`
test in include/rurp_vpp.h, and the source file's `#if RURP_HAS_VPP_DAC`
value test in src/rurp_vpp.cpp. This module is what proves each of those two
guards can actually fire, rather than assuming it -- the direct antidote to
the hollow-guard shape Phase 124 D-14 had to restructure, where a `#define`
sat roughly thirty lines above the `#if` that tested it and the guard could
not fire under any build configuration.

What the four board legs below actually prove: the seam consults exactly two
macros -- __AVR__ and RURP_HAS_VPP_DAC -- and nothing in it distinguishes Uno
from Leonardo from uno328pb. The four legs prove uniformity across ONE
compiler-supplied AVR fact plus ONE explicit ARM declaration, not four
independent per-board facts. The real AVR-cross-compiler resolution is
discharged by the three `pio run` builds Plan 125-04 performs, not by this
module -- do not let a reader infer more than that from the four legs below.

This module executes in NO CI leg on this branch: `pytest tests/ -v` appears
only in build.yml (push/PR to main) and beta-build.yml (push to beta) --
neither fires on the firmware milestone branch, and py32f071.yml has no
pytest step at all. The local run recorded in this phase's evidence artifact
is the only evidence this module's assertions were ever exercised.

Self-contained path resolution below -- NOT in conftest.py (firestarter/tests/
has no conftest.py anywhere in the repo, and none of pytest.ini,
pyproject.toml, setup.cfg or tox.ini exist either; a recorded house-rule
pattern decision, not an omission). Stdlib and pytest only.

Coverage:
  1. test_manual_control_on_every_board_macro_set -- one parametrized test,
     four board macro-sets (uno, leonardo, uno328pb, py32f071): compiles AND
     runs the seam, asserting compile exit 0, zero stderr bytes under
     -Wall -Wextra, run exit 0, and the two values parsed from stdout equal
     the manual mode (0) and the manual-adjustment-required result (1).
  2. test_forced_capability_macro_fails_closed_in_the_source -- D-03 via
     RESEARCH C-4: forcing RURP_HAS_VPP_DAC=1 while compiling
     src/rurp_vpp.cpp produces a non-zero compile exit carrying that file's
     own #error text; the header alone cannot reject this value (measured
     exit 0), so this leg is what makes the harness non-vacuous.
  3. test_unset_and_non_avr_fails_closed_in_the_header -- D-08: compiling
     with neither __AVR__ nor an explicit RURP_HAS_VPP_DAC defined produces
     a non-zero compile exit carrying include/rurp_vpp.h's own #error text.
  4. test_board_macro_sets_match_the_real_build_config -- D-04 via
     RESEARCH C-6: the four hardcoded board macro-sets above are kept
     honest by asserting their real anchors are still literally present in
     platformio.ini (the three AVR env headers + board lines) and
     platform/py32f071/CMakeLists.txt (the two ARM defines). Deliberately
     NOT anchored on the framework-supplied ARDUINO_AVR_* macros, which
     appear nowhere in platformio.ini and would fail this leg on arrival.
  5. test_build_supplies_the_capability_macro_the_header_only_tests --
     D-07: platform/py32f071/CMakeLists.txt's target_compile_definitions
     declares RURP_HAS_VPP_DAC=0, and separately,
     include/boards/py32f071_rurp_shield.h contains no top-level #define of
     that macro -- the regression guard against Phase 124's hollow-guard
     shape (a macro defined by the very file that tests it) returning here.
  6. test_seam_source_is_dependency_free -- D-02: src/rurp_vpp.cpp's only
     #include directive names the seam header itself. Turns D-02's
     standing constraint into something a future edit cannot quietly
     break.
  7. test_compiler_is_required_not_optional -- this module's own source
     contains no skip decorator and no skip call, so the fail-closed
     contract in _resolve_compiler is self-enforcing and cannot be
     silently bypassed by a future edit.
