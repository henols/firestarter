Phase 141 Plan 06 -- closes LOOP-02's and LOOP-07's own WORDING with a
committed source-scan gate, mechanized rather than merely asserted in a
phase record. The D-13 branch-inventory gate (test_protocol_branch_inventory.py)
proves the write path's predicate SHAPE moved when Phase 141 rewrote it; it
does not prove that the four constructs LOOP-02 names BY IDENTITY are gone,
and no existing gate proves LOOP-07's claim is GLOBAL (that no call path
anywhere in the tree can reach delayMicroseconds() above its 16383 us
ceiling). This module supplies exactly that: a mechanical, CI-visible oracle
in place of a prose claim.

Requirements: LOOP-02, LOOP-07

Defect class this closes: TWO distinct gaps, both structural rather than
behavioural, so neither can be caught merely by running the firmware --

  (a) a requirement whose wording names constructs BY IDENTITY (a macro, two
      named functions, a specific stack array) cannot be proven removed by a
      predicate-shape inventory alone -- a shape-preserving rewrite could in
      principle keep any of the four alive under a different branch shape,
      and the branch-inventory gate would not notice, because it counts
      branch predicates, not identifiers.

  (b) a GLOBAL claim about a call ceiling ("no call path can reach
      delayMicroseconds() above 16383 us") cannot be proven by a per-case
      native test alone, because a per-case test only ever exercises the
      cases it was written for -- it cannot show that every OTHER call site
      in the tree is already safe. A source-scan gate can.

Coverage:
  1. test_number_of_retries_macro_is_absent_from_the_write_path -- zero
     matches for the retry-count macro identifier (needle
     concatenation-built) in the comment-stripped write path.
  2. test_the_removed_block_mismatch_reporter_function_is_absent -- zero
     matches for the removed block-level mismatch-reporting function's
     identifier (needle concatenation-built). Named descriptively rather
     than after the identifier itself -- see the note directly below the
     Environment seams section for why.
  3. test_the_removed_verify_mask_updater_function_is_absent -- zero
     matches for the removed mask-updating function's identifier (needle
     concatenation-built), same shape as Coverage 2 and the same naming
     note applies.
  4. test_adaptive_pulse_growth_formula_is_absent -- zero matches for an
     assignment to handle->pulse_delay whose right-hand side contains both
     a '*' and a '/' (the shape of the removed adaptive-growth formula: a
     base delay scaled by a retries-proportional term), and zero matches
     for the removed byte-mismatch bitmask identifier (needle
     concatenation-built).
  5. test_the_per_byte_loop_constructs_are_present -- the positive
     counterpart to Coverage 1-4: the rewritten write path still contains
     firestarter_set_data, firestarter_get_data, MSG_ERR_MAX_PULSES and
     MSG_ERR_ENERGY_CAP, and the single budget-failure reporter is defined
     exactly once and called at least twice.
  6. test_no_unclamped_pulse_delay_reaches_delaymicroseconds -- zero
     matches for delayMicroseconds(handle->pulse_delay) across BOTH D-06
     sites (src/proms/eprom.cpp and src/proms/memory.cpp), comment-stripped.
  7. test_both_over_ceiling_sites_route_through_the_safe_helper -- the
     positive counterpart to Coverage 6: mem_util_delay_us(handle->pulse_delay)
     appears exactly once in EACH of the two D-06 sites -- exactly two call
     sites in total. A deleted call satisfies Coverage 6 vacuously and
     fails here.
  8. test_every_remaining_delaymicroseconds_argument_is_a_literal_or_a_clamped_value
     -- sweeps src/, include/, lib/ and platform/ for every remaining
     delayMicroseconds(...) CALL (never a macro-definition body, never the
     function's own definition) and asserts each argument is a decimal
     literal or one of the read path's three already-safe names
     (settling, strobe, the split helper's own bounded remainder).
  9. test_the_split_helper_ceiling_is_16383 -- MEM_UTIL_DELAY_US_MAX is
     defined as 16383UL in src/proms/memory.cpp and the split's first
     branch compares with <= against it, pinning the boundary that keeps
     every shipped pulse width emitting a single delayMicroseconds() call.
  10. test_scan_targets_are_non_vacuous -- both default scan targets exist,
      are non-empty, resolve inside this repository, and their
      comment-stripped text is non-empty. A missing or empty scan target
      must FAIL, never silently pass as if nothing needed checking.
  11. test_this_module_cannot_be_silently_skipped -- this module's own
      source contains no skip-bypass call, no skip-marker decorator and no
      dependency-skip call anywhere (all three checked via
      concatenation-built needles, the same technique Coverage 12 uses).
  12. test_own_needles_do_not_appear_verbatim_in_this_module -- the four
      concatenation-built LOOP-02 needles (Coverage 1-4) appear nowhere
      verbatim in this module's own source, so this gate cannot match
      itself.

Environment seams: (this repository has no central environment-variable
inventory -- this docstring is the only place a reader can discover them)
  - FIRESTARTER_WRITE_PATH_SCAN_SOURCE -- overrides the scanned
    src/proms/eprom.cpp path ONLY. src/proms/memory.cpp has no override --
    D-06 names it as a fixed site, and this module's own armed-gate proof
    exercises it the safer way for a single-file target (a temporary plant
    in the real file, captured, then restored) rather than adding a second
    seam. Consulted by Coverage 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 (the eprom.cpp half
    only). Binds at IMPORT time (the module-level Path(os.environ.get(...))
    expression below), so a planted-violation run must set it in a CHILD
    PROCESS environment before this module is imported, never via a
    post-import monkeypatch. Coverage 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 deliberately
    never read it: 8 and 9 scan fixed targets by design (D-06 names them
    and each is proven the seamless way); 10 recomputes the default
    targets directly from the repository root without ever reading
    os.environ; 11 and 12 read only this module's own source. A stray seam
    value left set after a planted run cannot make any of these five pass
    vacuously -- at worst it makes Coverage 1-7 fail loudly.

CI framing, stated honestly: `pytest tests/ -v` appears in
`.github/workflows/build.yml:161` and `.github/workflows/beta-build.yml:134`,
so this module -- like every other file under tests/ -- WILL run in CI once
this branch reaches `main` or `beta`. It does not run in any CI leg on the
milestone branch itself; that is a statement about this branch's current CI
wiring, not a claim that this module is permanently invisible to CI.

Naming note for Coverage 2 and 3: the two removed C functions' own names,
spelled out in full, are each a strict substring of the "obvious" test name
for the leg that proves them absent (the English words describing the
functions are, verbatim, the identifiers themselves) -- so a test literally
named after either identifier would make this module's own source contain,
verbatim, a needle it must instead prove is concatenation-built (Coverage
12's own check, and the same self-match hazard the module docstring's
opening paragraphs warn about). Coverage 2 and 3 are therefore named after
what the removed functions DID rather than after their identifiers; the
needle each leg actually searches for is still concatenation-built and
still exactly the removed identifier.

This module is a standalone pytest module: it is not named check_*.py (that
glob belongs to a different, paired convention this module does not need),
it adds no shared pytest configuration or fixture-registration file
anywhere -- firestarter/tests/ has none, by house convention, and this
module does not introduce one -- and it imports nothing beyond the Python
standard library. It never imports, parametrizes against, or edits any
pre-existing gate module; the scanning logic below is its own independent
re-derivation of this plan's own gate specification.
