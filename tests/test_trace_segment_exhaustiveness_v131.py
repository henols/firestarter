Phase 144 Plan 04 (TEST-06 / D-07) -- authors D-07's exhaustiveness gate: a
pytest module that parses BOTH v131 trace fixtures (the frozen pre-change
cadence and the new post-v1.31 cadence), walks each of the six arrays with a
structural state machine, partitions every entry into exactly one of six
named segments, and asserts that every segment present in either stream
carries a named attributing decision from Phases 140-143.

Requirements: TEST-06 (this plan does NOT mark it Complete -- 144-04-PLAN.md's
own scope note assigns all eight requirement flips of Phase 144 to plan
144-07; this module is evidence for that later flip, not the flip itself).

Defect class this closes: TEST-06 requires "every changed strobe attributable
to a named decision" -- "counts-plus-narrative" (a blanket snapshot update
wearing a paragraph) was explicitly rejected as satisfying this. A COUNT
check alone cannot prove attribution completeness: one entry deleted and one
duplicated leaves an array's length unchanged and must still be caught. This
module makes the attribution machine-checked for completeness -- 1001 entries
(620 pre-change + 381 new), every one landing in exactly one attributed
segment, an unattributed or unclassifiable entry failing loudly and
locatably.

**Honest boundary, stated once here and repeated in the per-test docstrings
below: this gate proves the attribution is COMPLETE (no segment is
unattributed, no entry is unsegmented) -- it does NOT prove that any single
attribution is itself CORRECT. Correctness of "which decision explains this
segment" is a human judgement recorded in the phase record (Phases 140-143);
completeness of "every entry lands somewhere named" is what is machine
checked here.**

Coverage:
  1. test_prechange_arrays_parse_to_the_recorded_lengths -- the frozen
     pre-change fixture's three arrays parse to exactly (198, 221, 201)
     entries, positional, first-divergence message naming index/expected/
     observed.
  2. test_new_arrays_parse_to_the_captured_lengths -- same shape against the
     new fixture's (131, 149, 101).
  3. test_every_entry_falls_in_exactly_one_segment -- D-07's core assertion:
     for each of the six arrays, the union of the six segment index sets
     equals set(range(len(entries))) AND the six sets are pairwise disjoint.
     Set equality and disjointness -- never a count sum. On failure, names
     the array, stream, every uncovered/duplicated index and its
     (kind,pin,value,us) tuple.
  4. test_every_present_segment_has_a_named_attribution -- every one of the
     six names in _SEGMENTS carries a non-empty _SEGMENT_ATTRIBUTION entry
     (checked unconditionally), and every segment with at least one
     attributed index in either stream is re-checked, naming the orphan
     segment on failure.
  5. test_pre_change_0x07_pulse_and_verify_counts_match_the_output_enable_toggles
     -- the F-07 known-answer self-test: on the pre-change 0x07 array the
     machine must find 7 pulse windows and 12 verify reads, and 7 + 12 must
     equal the independently-recounted total of pin==_PIN_OE strobes (19).
     This is what proves the state machine is not merely self-consistent.
  6. test_total_attributed_entry_count_matches_the_floor -- the six arrays' ATTRIBUTED
     totals (derived from _segment_indices, never the raw parsed length
     alone) sum to _TOTAL_ENTRY_FLOOR, with the 620/381 per-stream subtotals
     named in the message.
  7. test_scan_targets_are_non_vacuous -- self-protection, two halves. Part
     (a) recomputes both DEFAULT paths from _REPO_ROOT WITHOUT reading
     os.environ, asserting each is a non-empty file inside the repo. Part
     (b) runs the parser against whatever the two seams CURRENTLY resolve
     to, asserting three arrays each with a non-empty entry list, and a
     combined total >= _TOTAL_ENTRY_FLOOR.
  8. test_this_module_cannot_be_silently_skipped -- this module's own
     source contains no skip-bypass call, no skip-marker decorator, and no
     dependency-skip call anywhere, each needle concatenation-built.
  9. test_own_needles_do_not_appear_verbatim_in_this_module -- every
     concatenation-built needle from Coverage 8 appears NOWHERE verbatim in
     this module's own source.
  10. test_planted_unclassifiable_entry_is_located -- D-18 Plant A. One
      entry in a SCRATCH copy of the new fixture is mutated to an
      unclassifiable shape (pin 0x40, none of the five known pins), run
      through Coverage 3's own leg in a CHILD PROCESS (the seam binds at
      import; monkeypatch.setenv cannot reach it), and the RED transcript
      must name the array, the positional index, and the (kind,pin,value,us)
      tuple containing 0x40.
  11. test_planted_delete_and_duplicate_defeats_a_count_only_check -- D-18
      Plant B. One entry is deleted and a DIFFERENT entry is duplicated
      inside the SAME array of a scratch copy, so the array's length is
      UNCHANGED -- proving a count-only check would pass -- yet the
      partition leg still fails, and the failure is attributable to the
      set-equality/disjointness assertion, not to a length mismatch.

Environment seams: (this repository has no central environment-variable
inventory -- this docstring is the only place a reader can discover them,
mirroring tests/test_ack_layout_source_contract_v143.py's and
tests/test_requirement_case_mapping_v131.py's own convention)
  - FIRESTARTER_TRACE_SEGMENT_SCAN_NEW -- overrides the scanned PATH to the
    new (post-v1.31) fixture ONLY -- never a segment name, never an expected
    length, never the _TOTAL_ENTRY_FLOOR denominator. Binds at IMPORT time (the
    module-level `Path(os.environ.get(...))` expression below), so a
    planted-violation run must set it in a CHILD PROCESS environment before
    this module is imported, never via a post-import monkeypatch
    (monkeypatch.setenv has no effect on an already-bound module-level
    value). Coverage 10 and 11 are the two legs that set it, always through
    `_run_gate_in_subprocess`, never through monkeypatch.setenv (S6).
  - FIRESTARTER_TRACE_SEGMENT_SCAN_PRECHANGE -- overrides the scanned PATH
    to the frozen pre-change fixture ONLY, same path-only/import-time-bound
    rules as above. No planted leg in this module redirects this seam (both
    plants mutate the NEW stream only), but it is read on every import and
    documented here for the same discoverability reason.
  - FIRESTARTER_144_GATE_CHILD -- a child-process recursion guard only, read
    (never written by anything but `_run_gate_in_subprocess` itself) to
    refuse spawning a nested gate subprocess from inside one. It is not a
    behavioural seam: it carries no path, no floor and no segment name, and
    no test above reads it for any other purpose. Reused (not reinvented)
    from tests/test_requirement_case_mapping_v131.py's own
    FIRESTARTER_144_GATE_CHILD, itself copied structurally from
    tests/test_flash_path_record_sync.py's FIRESTARTER_129_GATE_CHILD.

This module is a standalone pytest module: it is not named check_*.py (see
tests/test_checker_convention.py's FLOOR=6 / FIXTURE_FLOOR=15, both at
exactly the current counts -- authoring a scripts/check_*.py checker here
would obligate raising both in the same commit, which this plan does not
do), it adds no shared pytest configuration or fixture-registration file
anywhere (firestarter/tests/ has none, by house convention, and this module
does not introduce one), and it imports nothing beyond the Python standard
library: os, re and pathlib for the parse/segmentation/self-protection legs
(Coverage 1-9); subprocess, shutil and sys additionally for the D-18
planted-violation legs' child-process runs and fail-closed git resolution
(Coverage 10-11). It never imports _parse_arrays, _ARRAY_DECL_RE or any
other helper defined in test_golden_trace_identity_eprom_v131.py -- that
module's own docstring requires two INDEPENDENT readings, so the parse
technique below is re-implemented, never imported. It never edits src/
(D-04) and
never modifies either fixture header -- both are read-only inputs here;
every planted mutation below is a SCRATCH copy under tmp_path.

Self-contained path resolution below -- NOT in conftest.py (firestarter/
tests/ has no conftest.py anywhere in the repo; a recorded house-rule
pattern, not an omission). Stdlib and pytest only.
