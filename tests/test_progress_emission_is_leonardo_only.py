Phase 143 Plan 08 (BF-2 closure; keeps HOST-02's firmware half honest;
protects HOST-03 on Uno-class boards) -- pins, as a SOURCE CONTRACT, that
plan 143-05's intra-block MSG_DATA_PROGRESS (0xE0) emission inside
eprom.cpp's per-byte write loop is compiled OUT -- the emission and its
millis() state variable, both -- on every Uno-class build, and compiled in
everywhere else.

Requirements: none. 143-08-PLAN.md's own frontmatter `requirements: []` is
deliberate: this plan marks no requirement Complete. It contributes the gate
that keeps HOST-02 honest and protects HOST-03 on Uno-class boards; plan
143-10 flips the HOST-* checkboxes once every plan's evidence exists.

Why a SOURCE CONTRACT, never a behavioural oracle (mirrors
tests/test_hv_routing_source_contract_v142.py's own framing; Phase 142's
command_done() gate is the precedent this module follows): the file that
implements the hazard this guard exists to prevent --
src/boards/uno_rurp_shield.cpp, which defines com_mode, the strong
rurp_log_id() override and the 4-slot deferred_log buffer -- is compiled in
NO native environment. Every native env's build_src_filter is `+<proms/>
+<boards/rurp_serial_utils.cpp> +<json_parser.c> +<operation_utils.cpp>`:
note that <boards/rurp_serial_utils.cpp> is named but <boards/
uno_rurp_shield.cpp> never is. And the native rurp_log_id capture stub
(test/native/avr/test_loop_eprom_v131/host_stubs.cpp and every sibling
suite's own copy) captures every frame UNCONDITIONALLY -- grep for
"com_mode" under test/ returns zero hits anywhere. A native test therefore
records every emitted frame regardless of build configuration and proves
NOTHING about Uno-class delivery: it cannot distinguish "delivered" from
"would have been delivered if the UART were not torn down for the whole
programmer-mode window." Only a scan of the checked-in source TEXT can pin
this guard's presence, so that is what this module does -- never state,
here or in the SUMMARY or the phase record, that any behavioural evidence
backs the Uno-class non-delivery half of this claim.

BF-2, in full (143-RESEARCH.md): on uno/uno328pb the whole per-byte write
loop runs inside one programmer-mode window (operation_utils.cpp's
_execute_operation calls rurp_set_programmer_mode(); callback(handle);
rurp_set_communication_mode();), and rurp_set_programmer_mode()
(src/boards/uno_rurp_shield.cpp) tears the UART down for the block's whole
duration via rurp_serial_end(). The Uno's strong rurp_log_id() override
(same file) DEFERS frames into a 4-slot buffer (DEFERRED_LOG_MAX 4) while
com_mode is false, and a 5th deferred frame is silently DROPPED (that
file's own sizing-rationale comment: "an operation emits at most ~1-2
critical frames per programmer-mode window"). An unguarded intra-block
progress emission would fill those four slots, so the MSG_ERR_MAX_PULSES
frame a failing block needs to send would be dropped on its fifth attempt
-- turning a program FAILURE (HOST-03's exact target: a program failure
naming the address, not a transport error) into a host SerialTimeoutError,
on a path that works today without this emission. The guard this module
pins is therefore load-bearing for HOST-03, not merely for HOST-02's own
progress bar -- and an unguarded emission would be a REGRESSION, not a
missing feature.

Second, smaller thing this module pins: plan 143-05's millis() state
variable (the emission's own last-frame timestamp) is inside the SAME guard
class as the emission itself. An unreferenced local on a build that defines
the flag is an unused-variable warning, and
scripts/baseline/size_baseline.json's AVR policy is exactly zero warnings
(avr_rule: "== 0") -- a gate that pinned only the emission would let that
regression back in silently.

D-06's non-claim, both dimensions, restated here because this module is
where the SECOND dimension is mechanically enforced (Coverage 7): intra-
block write progress is emitted on the EPROM path only (not flash, not
EEPROM, not SRAM), and delivered on leonardo only -- a STRUCTURAL
consequence of the flag this module pins, not a choice this module makes.

Coverage:
  1. test_the_progress_emit_exists_inside_the_write_execute_body -- exactly
     one MSG_DATA_PROGRESS reference inside the brace-matched
     eprom_internal_write_execute_body. A second emit would mean two
     cadences.
  2. test_the_progress_emit_is_inside_a_serial_on_io_guard -- the emit's
     offset falls inside a region whose OWN opening directive is an
     #ifndef naming the Uno-class build flag, determined by scanning every
     preprocessor conditional directive in the body IN ORDER and pairing
     each with its OWN matching #endif via depth tracking -- never by a
     nearby-substring heuristic, which would pass for an emit that merely
     follows an unrelated guard elsewhere in the same function.
  3. test_the_millis_state_variable_is_inside_the_same_guard_class -- the
     millis() state variable's OWN declaration is ALSO inside such a
     region, checked independently of Coverage 2. Message states the
     zero-warning AVR policy reason directly: a leg pinning only the emit
     would let an unused-variable regression back in.
  4. test_the_emit_precedes_the_skip_continues -- the emit's offset is LESS
     than the offset of the "expected == 0xFF" skip inside the same body,
     so the cadence is independent of how many bytes are skipped (D-03's
     placement rationale).
  5. test_the_emit_uses_the_named_interval_constant -- the emit's own
     time-since-last-frame comparison names the EPROM_PROGRESS_EMIT_INTERVAL_MS
     constant, and no bare decimal literal appears in that comparison
     instead -- a literal would let the native cadence case and the
     firmware's own predicate drift apart silently.
  6. test_the_payload_keeps_one_contract_for_the_id -- the emit's second
     argument is the handle's chip-geometry field (an ABSOLUTE quantity);
     the forbidden block-relative payload alternative (concatenation-built
     -- see the Naming note below) does not appear inside the emit's own
     block. D-04: 0xE0 must keep exactly one payload meaning across its two
     emitters (this one and mem_util_blank_check's pre-existing one in
     memory.cpp).
  7. test_serial_on_io_is_defined_on_exactly_the_uno_class_envs -- the
     Uno-class build flag's exact compiler-invocation spelling
     (concatenation-built -- see the Naming note below) is present in
     exactly the uno and uno328pb env sections of platformio.ini, and
     absent from every other env section, leonardo and every native* env
     included -- so D-06's "delivered on leonardo only" half stays true
     against a future platformio.ini edit in EITHER direction.
  8. test_scan_targets_are_non_vacuous -- both default scan targets
     (eprom.cpp, platformio.ini), recomputed from _REPO_ROOT WITHOUT
     reading os.environ, exist, are non-empty and resolve inside this
     repository; and the extracted write-execute body (from whatever the
     seam-aware target currently resolves to) is itself non-empty and
     contains at least one #ifndef directive.
  9. test_this_module_cannot_be_silently_skipped -- concatenation-built
     skip needles.
  10. test_own_needles_do_not_appear_verbatim_in_this_module -- proves the
      concatenation discipline stays machine-checked.

Environment seams: (this repository has no central environment-variable
inventory -- this docstring is the only place a reader can discover them,
mirroring test_hv_routing_source_contract_v142.py's and
test_ack_layout_source_contract_v143.py's own convention)
  - FIRESTARTER_PROGRESS_SCAN_EPROM_SOURCE -- overrides the scanned
    src/proms/eprom.cpp path ONLY. Consulted by Coverage 1-6 and the second
    half of Coverage 8. Binds at IMPORT time (the module-level
    `Path(os.environ.get(...))` expression below), so a planted-violation
    run must set it in a CHILD PROCESS environment before this module is
    imported, never via a post-import monkeypatch.
  - FIRESTARTER_PROGRESS_SCAN_PIO_CONFIG -- overrides the scanned
    platformio.ini path ONLY. Consulted by Coverage 7. Binds at import
    time, same as above. Does not collide with plan 143-03's
    FIRESTARTER_ACK_SCAN_DISPATCH_SOURCE (a different variable name,
    scanning a different file).
  - Coverage 8's default-path half, Coverage 9 and Coverage 10 deliberately
    never read either seam: Coverage 8's first half recomputes both
    default targets directly from the repository root without ever
    reading os.environ (the check_permitted_claims.py `_HERE`-resolves-
    to-the-wrong-directory landmine, closed here by construction, the same
    technique both analog modules' own non-vacuity legs use); 9 and 10 read
    only this module's own source. A stray seam value left set after a
    planted run cannot make Coverage 8's default-path half, 9 or 10 pass
    vacuously -- at worst Coverage 1-7 and Coverage 8's second half
    redirect to whatever the seam happens to point at, which fails loudly
    rather than silently.

Naming note -- a deliberate departure from the two analogs' simpler
convention, recorded here because the reasoning is not obvious by
inspection: this module's central subject IS the Uno-class build flag, so
its BARE macro name necessarily appears throughout this docstring, this
module's own regex patterns (Coverage 2, 3 and 8's positive-detection
logic) and assertion messages -- exactly as "CONTROL_REGISTER" and
"handle->protocol" appear freely throughout test_hv_routing_source_
contract_v142.py without being registered as self-check needles, because
they are not themselves forbidden constructs. Registering the bare macro
name as a self-check needle would make Coverage 10 fail against this
module's OWN necessary, legitimate prose. What IS registered instead is the
flag's exact COMPILER-INVOCATION spelling -- the literal text pairing a
"-D" flag immediately against the macro name, exactly as it appears on its
own line in platformio.ini -- because prose describing the flag naturally
names it without that prefix immediately attached (nobody writes "the -D
SERIAL_ON_IO flag" in running English; they write "the SERIAL_ON_IO flag").
Coverage 7's own detection regex is built with `-D\\s+<name>` (a regex
escape sequence, not a literal space) rather than from the registered
needle, so it can never itself satisfy Coverage 10 by accident. The same
discipline applies to the forbidden block-relative payload alternative in
Coverage 6: no test name or docstring sentence above spells it out
verbatim -- each is named after what it forbids, never after its exact
token, so this module's own test names and prose cannot become the thing
Coverage 10 has to catch.

CI framing, stated honestly (mirrors both analogs' own section): `pytest
tests/ -v` appears in .github/workflows/build.yml:161 and
.github/workflows/beta-build.yml:134, so this module -- like every other
file under tests/ -- WILL run in CI once this branch reaches main or beta.
It does not run in any CI leg on the milestone branch itself; that is a
statement about this branch's current CI wiring, not a claim that this
module is permanently invisible to CI.

This module is a standalone pytest module: it is not named check_*.py, it
adds no shared pytest configuration or fixture-registration file anywhere
(firestarter/tests/ has none, by house convention, and this module does not
introduce one), and it imports nothing beyond the Python standard library
(os, re, pathlib). It never imports, parametrizes against, or edits
tests/test_hv_routing_source_contract_v142.py or
tests/test_ack_layout_source_contract_v143.py -- the scanning logic below
is its own independent re-derivation of this plan's own gate specification,
and neither analog module is modified by this one.

    """Coverage 6b -- debug session w27c512-write-slow-3x. Pins a REAL
    behavioural change to the emission contract, so it is recorded rather
    than silently tolerated by the widened locator above.

    WHAT CHANGED. The loop this module scans is no longer per-byte; it is
    pass-batched (a scan pass alternating with a pulse pass), and the scan
    pass restarts at index 0 on every pass. MSG_DATA_PROGRESS (0xE0) carries
    an ABSOLUTE chip address, and the host applies it verbatim -- it assigns
    the bar's position rather than advancing it
    (firestarter_app/firestarter/eprom_operations.py::_apply_write_progress
    sets progress.pbar.n = position). So a frame emitted from a LATER pass
    would carry a LOWER address than one already sent and the host's write
    bar would visibly rewind. Gating the emit on the first pass is what makes
    0xE0's address sequence monotonic within a block, which is the property
    the host relies on.

    THE CONSEQUENCE, stated because it is a real behaviour change and not a
    no-op: the first scan pass of a 1024-byte block completes in well under
    the 1000 ms interval, so on an ordinary write this emit now fires ZERO
    times per block and the host falls back to its per-chunk handoff bar --
    the same path every uno/uno328pb write already takes, which the host
    handles by design (its firmware_drives_bar latch simply never engages).
    That is not a user-visible regression: a block now completes in ~0.44 s
    where the per-byte loop took ~1.57 s, so per-chunk granularity is FINER
    in wall-clock terms than the 1 s intra-block cadence it replaces. The
    emit is kept, not deleted, because a slow row (a multi-pass block, or a
    0x0B part at 500 us pulses) can still exceed the interval inside the
    first pass.

    This leg exists so that removing the gate -- which would restore the
    rewinding bar -- fails here, and so that a future reader learns the
    reason from a test rather than from a git archaeology session."""
