     * PASS-BATCHED program loop: a scan pass and a pulse pass, alternating.

     *         previous pass, so the read count per byte is unchanged.
     *   PULSE (route asserted once): strobe every flagged byte at org_delay.
     *
     * The batching is the point: asserting the route per BYTE costs 1100 us of
     * settle each time -- 1531 us/byte, ~106 s for a 64 KiB device, measured. One
     * settle per block instead of 1024 of them.
     *
     * Preserved from the per-byte loop, precisely:
     *   - A 0xFF target is never read and never pulsed; an already-matching byte
     *     is read once and never pulsed.
     *   - The pulse width is always org_delay, never grown.
     *   - `pulses` is the per-BYTE count, not a pass counter: every flagged byte
     *     is strobed exactly once per pulse pass.
     *   - max_pulses / energy_cap_us are tested only AFTER a failed verify and
     *     after the converged-early break, so a byte converging on its last
     *     permitted pulse still succeeds.
     *   - `pending` is deliberately NOT cleared between passes, so the scan can
     *     distinguish "was flagged, now matches" (converged this pass) from
     *     "never flagged" (matched all along) -- the state overprogram needs.
     *
     * MARGIN IS NOT TRADED FOR SPEED. The route is held up for the whole pulse
     * pass, so every strobe after the first sees a better-settled rail than the
     * per-pulse version gave. OE/VPP still comes fully down before every verify
     * read, which is the Program-Verify requirement that forces the assert.
