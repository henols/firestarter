     * Debug session w27c512-write-slow-3x -- PASS-BATCHED program loop.

     * WHAT CHANGED, AND THE MEASUREMENT THAT FORCED IT. This used to be a
     * single per-BYTE loop whose inner convergence loop called
     * eprom_internal_program_pulse() once per byte. That helper asserts the
     * program-voltage route, waits EPROM_VPP_SETUP_US, strobes, waits
     * EPROM_VPP_HOLD_US and de-asserts -- so it spent 1100 us of pure
     * route-settle PER BYTE. Measured on the bench (leonardo, W27C512,
     * 64 KiB pseudorandom image, 238 bytes of 0xFF): 1.568 s per 1024-byte
     * block = 1531 us/byte, 105.9 s for the device. gh#36's reporter
     * measured the same operation at 29.71 s on the v2.x firmware and
     * 108.74 s on v3.x; gh#42 recorded 139.2 s. include/eprom.h's own
     * EPROM_VPP_SETUP_US comment predicted this cost exactly ("~110 s per
     * 64 KiB write") -- it was simply never compared against v2.x.
     *
     * v2.0.6's program_mismatched_bytes() asserted the route ONCE per pass,
     * paid its settle ONCE per pass, strobed every flagged byte in the
     * block, then verified in a SEPARATE pass with the route down. That
     * amortisation -- one settle per 1024-byte block instead of 1024 of
     * them -- is what is restored here.
     *
     * SHAPE: a scan pass and a pulse pass, alternating.
     *   SCAN  (route down): read every byte still short of its target and
     *         flag it in `pending`. This IS the previous loop's LOOP-06 skip
     *         pair, and it is ALSO the post-pulse verify for the pass before
     *         it -- one read serves both roles, so the read count per byte
     *         is unchanged from the per-byte loop (scan, re-scan, final
     *         verify = 3).
     *   PULSE (route asserted once): strobe every flagged byte at org_delay.
     *
     * WHAT IS PRESERVED, precisely:
     *   - LOOP-06: a 0xFF target is never read and never pulsed; an
     *     already-matching byte is read once and never pulsed.
     *   - LOOP-01: the pulse width is always org_delay, never grown.
     *   - Per-byte pulse accounting: every flagged byte is strobed exactly
     *     once per pulse pass, so a byte still flagged after `pulses` passes
     *     has received exactly `pulses` pulses. `pulses` IS the per-byte
     *     count, not merely a pass counter.
     *   - Verify after every pulse: the scan pass immediately following a
     *     pulse pass reads back every byte that pass strobed, before any
     *     further pulse is emitted.
     *   - max_pulses / energy_cap_us, still tested only AFTER a failed
     *     verify and only after the converged-early break, so a byte that
     *     converges on its last permitted pulse still succeeds.
     *   - LOOP-03 overprogram, at the converging byte's OWN pulse count --
     *     `pending` is deliberately NOT cleared between passes so the scan
     *     can tell "was flagged, now matches" (converged THIS pass) from
     *     "never flagged" (matched all along), which is the only state
     *     needed to keep that per-byte fidelity.
     *   - The final full-block verify pass (VERIFY_PER_PULSE_PLUS_FINAL).
     *
     * MARGIN IS NOT TRADED FOR SPEED. The route is held up for the whole
     * pulse pass, so every strobe after the first sees a rail that has been
     * up for milliseconds -- strictly better settled than the per-pulse
     * 1000 us this replaces. And OE/VPP still comes fully down before every
     * verify read, which is the W27C512 Program-Verify requirement that
     * forced the per-pulse assert in the first place (see include/eprom.h's
     * EPROM_VPP_SETUP_US comment for that constraint in full).
     *
     * `pending` is a stack bitmask of DATA_BUFFER_SIZE/8 bytes (128 on
     * leonardo, 64 on uno-class) -- byte-for-byte the allocation v2.0.6's
     * mismatch_bitmask made on the same boards. It costs no static RAM.

         * progress, compiled in on leonardo and native only.
         *
         * BF-2 (143-RESEARCH.md), in full: on uno/uno328pb the whole
         * per-byte loop runs inside one programmer-mode window
         * (operation_utils.cpp's _execute_operation calls
         * rurp_set_programmer_mode(); callback(handle); rurp_set_
         * communication_mode();), and rurp_set_programmer_mode()
         * (src/boards/uno_rurp_shield.cpp) tears the UART down for the
         * block's whole duration via rurp_serial_end(). The Uno's strong
         * rurp_log_id() override (same file) DEFERS rather than emits while
         * com_mode == false, into a 4-slot deferred_log buffer
         * (DEFERRED_LOG_MAX); a 5th deferred frame is silently DROPPED. On
         * this path that dropped slot would be one a subsequent
         * MSG_ERR_MAX_PULSES frame needs, turning a program FAILURE into a
         * host transport timeout -- exactly HOST-03's anti-goal, on a path
         * that works today without this emission.
         *
         * The same trap is already documented in-tree, twice, each guarded
         * at RUNTIME: src/boards/uno_rurp_shield.cpp's own DEFERRED_LOG_MAX
         * sizing-rationale comment ("an operation emits at most ~1-2
         * critical frames per programmer-mode window"), and
         * mem_util_blank_check's MSG_DATA_PROGRESS emit comment in
         * src/proms/memory.cpp, which gates on `handle->cmd !=
         * CMD_BLANK_CHECK`. This call site has no handle->cmd it could
         * test that way (eprom_write_execute only ever runs for CMD_WRITE),
         * so it is guarded at COMPILE time instead -- same defect class,
         * different mechanism.
         *
         * Rejected mitigations (each keeps the trap, at a cost):
         *   - a runtime com_mode accessor: costs an accessor call on every
         *     target and still delivers no intra-block progress on Uno,
         *     with no mechanism to reserve the error-frame slots;
         *   - raising DEFERRED_LOG_MAX: RAM cost on the tightest-RAM
         *     target, and still zero intra-block delivery on Uno;
         *   - reserving headroom by emitting at most DEFERRED_LOG_MAX - 2
         *     frames: a fragile invariant split across two files, and
         *     still no delivery on Uno.
         *
         * D-06's non-claim, both dimensions: intra-block write progress is
         * emitted on the EPROM path only, and delivered on leonardo only.
         *
         * The predicate below is TIME-keyed (millis()) and reads no
         * handle->protocol at all, so it adds no tier-1 protocol-keyed
         * site -- configure_eprom's pulse-fallback switch (:70) remains
         * this file's only one (TABLE-05).
         *
         * Payload is (absolute chip address, handle->mem_size) -- identical
         * shape to mem_util_blank_check's own MSG_DATA_PROGRESS emit
         * (memory.cpp), so 0xE0 keeps exactly ONE payload contract; a
         * block-relative pair (D-04's rejected alternative) would have
         * given the id a second meaning depending on which operation
         * emitted it.
         *
         * Placed BEFORE the LOOP-06 skips just below, so the cadence is
         * independent of how many bytes are skipped -- the more honest
         * reading of "progress" than gating on bytes actually pulsed.
         *
         * Unsigned-difference form: a millis() rollover (~49.7 days)
         * cannot stall the cadence -- (uint32_t) subtraction wraps
         * correctly regardless of which side of the rollover last_emit_ms
         * sits on.

 * the success fall-through, control returns HERE, and this conditional is
 * the ONLY place that decides whether to clear the shared composite --

 * bypass it.
 *
 * Conditional on RESPONSE_CODE_ERROR, not unconditional -- D-10's original

 * The tiebreaker is test_loop_eprom_v131.cpp's
 * test_loop05_a_successful_block_does_not_disable_the_route, which asserts
 * a SUCCESSFUL block leaves CTRL_VPP_REGULATOR_ENABLE SET. An unconditional
 * disable would re-arm the once-per-block guard above and re-pay
 * delay(500) on the very next block too -- roughly 64s added to a 64K Uno
 * write (128 blocks) against a typical 0x07 write's ~32s total at 100us
 * pulses. The OPERATION-level disable (as opposed to this per-block loop's
 * own disable-on-error) is command_done() (firestarter.cpp:162-171), which
 * zeroes CONTROL_REGISTER unconditionally on every command exit, success
