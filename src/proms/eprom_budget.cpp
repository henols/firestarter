 * Phase 143 Plan 01 (HOST-01, firmware half -- BF-3 as corrected) -- the
 * corrected per-block worst-case write-time budget arithmetic declared in
 * eprom_budget.h. Reads the const, PROGMEM eprom_params table
 * (eprom_params.h / eprom_params.cpp) and calls the shipped
 * overprogram-duration function (eprom.h / eprom.cpp) rather than
 * restating either.
 *
 * No Arduino framework header is included here (140-RESEARCH.md Pitfall
 * 1): src/proms/not_implemented.cpp is the only other translation unit
 * under src/proms/ that omits it, and this file follows that include
 * discipline verbatim so it adds zero macro-redefinition warnings on the
 * native build. PROGMEM access comes transitively through eprom_params.h
 * (which pulls in the platform PROGMEM compatibility shim) -- this file
 * never includes that shim directly.
 *
 * Verified include chain for eprom.h, confirming it too is free of any
 * Arduino framework header: eprom.h -> firestarter.h -> rurp_shield.h ->
 * the platform PROGMEM compatibility shim (include/rurp_platform_compat.h)
 * -- none of the three includes any Arduino core header, so pulling in
 * eprom.h here (for the shipped overprogram function) adds no framework
 * dependency.
 *
 * This is a NEW, unpinned translation unit under src/proms/ -- deliberately
 * NOT folded into eprom.cpp or eprom_params.cpp. tests/golden/
 * protocol_branch_inventory.json's meta.blob_shas pins exactly those two
 * files; putting this arithmetic in either would fold it into plan
 * 143-05's D-23 single-commit eprom.cpp constraint and turn the golden RED
 * for two reasons at once. build_src_filter's directory glob (+<proms/>,
 * platformio.ini) compiles this file under every native environment with
 * no platformio.ini edit.
