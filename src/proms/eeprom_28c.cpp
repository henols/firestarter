/* AT28C_PAGE_SIZE_FALLBACK 64 is a deliberate CONSERVATIVE FLOOR (D-13, and
 * D-10 of Phase 149: renamed from the old unqualified identifier, which
 * claimed to be *the* page size -- that claim was half of what made this
 * comment misleading). A mem_size-derived band table (the shape flash_5v_page.cpp's
 * flash_5v_page_page_size() uses -- READ-ONLY ANALOG, FIX-04 frozen -- NOT
 * adopted here) would be WRONG for 0x0D: the pinned infoic.xml (commit
 * a8efaedc, <database type='INFOIC2PLUS'>) records AT28MC010 at 128 KB with
 * page_size = 0x0040 (64) while AT28C010 at the SAME 128 KB density carries
 * 0x0080 (128) -- same density, different page size, so density alone
 * cannot select the right value. D-01 re-verified this argument, and both
 * chips are in the delivered set below.
 *
 * The floor's safety for the 66 rows Phase 149 D-04 leaves on it is
 * unproven, not disproven: their page_size comes from records filed
 * upstream under other algorithms (0x07/0x0B), so we cannot assert their
 * real page is 16 or 32 either -- the page_size attribute is meaningful for
 * the algorithm that consumes it, and a record filed under 0x07/0x0B is not
 * evidence about a 28C page buffer.
 *
 * Phase 149 (PGSZ-01/PGSZ-02) delivered the per-chip value for the 18
 * upstream-native 0x0D rows: infoic.xml -> build_db.py -> chip_database.json
 * -> wire -> json_parser.c -> the mask resolver below --
 * software-proven and unvalidated on silicon. AT28C_PAGE_SIZE_MAX (512) is a
 * deliberately board-invariant validation ceiling, not the buffer-size
 * constant (512 on uno/uno328pb/native, 1024 on leonardo), so the
 * validation contract is one rule on all four build environments and the
 * native test's coverage of it is total; 512 is still at or above the
 * largest page any row in the database carries (256). */

// and the shared frozen header stays untouched (mirrors Phase 117 D-10's

// D-10, and this is a SAFETY property, not a style point: {0x5555,0xAA},
// {0x2AAA,0x55}, {0x5555,0xA0} is byte-identical to FLASH_ENABLE_WRITE (the
// PROTECTED-WRITE PREFIX) and to FLASH_ENABLE_WRITE_PROTECTION. The ONLY
// thing separating "lock the chip" from "prefix a byte write" is that NO
// DATA WRITE FOLLOWS this sequence. That makes the absence of a payload a
// hard safety invariant, not a convenience -- it is why LOCK-05 requires the
// flash_utils.h duplication PRESERVED rather than deduped (the array NAME is
// the only discriminator once the bytes match, so deduping would destroy
// real semantics; abandoned commit 0052c42 stays abandoned), and it is why
// that absence cannot be asserted by comparing tables -- it has to be
// asserted on the emitted STREAM instead (Plan 119-05's no-payload +
// exact-divergence-index cases).
//
// ROADMAP criterion 5 asks for this rationale as a header comment on
// flash_utils.h; flash_utils.h is FIX-04 byte-frozen (git diff --quiet
// confirms it untouched by this plan), so that file is deliberately NOT
// edited. This comment, here, is the first of the two records that

// (118's bounded DQ6 toggle poll for the unlock, D-11's plain t_WC delay for
// the lock -- two DIFFERENT waits) is deliberately EXCLUDED from this
// bracket and stays at each call site: check_no_log_in_sdp_window.py
// requires a wait anchor positioned after the emit anchor inside
// eeprom28c_write_init's own body, and folding either wait shape into this
// helper would either break that gate's anchor search or force one wait
// shape onto both sequences.
//
// The budget is derived from `length` -- NEVER a literal 3 or 6 -- so it
// tracks whichever sequence is passed automatically: 6 writes gives 600 us
// for the unlock, 3 gives 300 us for the lock. F-118-01 measured 572 us
// against the unlock's 600 us budget on a real Leonardo -- a 4.7% margin --
// so this check is load-bearing on both paths, not a latent invariant that

// function, and a different electrical mechanism, and nothing in this body
// resembles it.
//

// reusing eeprom28c_sdp_unlock_execute(handle) verbatim, even though AN
// 0544B is silent on whether
// the six-byte erase code is decoded on a protected part. The asymmetry:
// if it is not decoded while protected, the failure is a phantom erase that
// reports OK having erased nothing -- and on this family SDP state is
// unreadable (Phase 151), so no oracle could ever catch that phantom erase
// after the fact. The cost of disabling SDP first, on an already-unprotected
// part, is six harmless extra bus writes and one t_WC wait. Silence is not
// permission when the failure mode this way is invisible.
//
// D-153-04: this erase is device-global by construction -- the AN 0544B
// sequence erases the whole part -- and it ignores any sector address; no
// post-erase blank check is wired (erase -b stays a documented no-op here,
// `blank` remains its own independent step).
