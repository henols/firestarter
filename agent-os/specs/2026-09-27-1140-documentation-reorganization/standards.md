# Standards for Documentation Reorganization

The following standards apply to this work.

---

## host/help-docstrings

# Click Docstrings Are --help

A command docstring and every `help=` string are user documentation. Click prints them as `--help`.

- No internal references: no phase or plan IDs, requirement tags (`WRITE-01`), `file:line`, or maintainer notes.
- Put implementation reasoning in a `#` comment in the function body, not in the docstring.
- Write in ASD-STE100 (same as refusal text).
- Do not add tests that pin `--help` text.

## testing/non-vacuity

# Prove a Check Can Fail

Every new check (gate, guard, refusal) ships with committed tests that feed it violating input and assert that it refuses.

```python
def test_is_affected_true_at_bit_19(): ...                   # refuses
def test_is_affected_false_at_bit_18(): ...                  # boundary: passes
def test_require_acknowledged_no_bus_key_raises_fail_closed(): ...  # absent evidence
```

- Test both sides of each threshold.
- For a fail-closed check, test `None` / empty / missing input.
- The violation is in the input data (synthetic pin map, bad page size). Never mutate source to plant it.
- A test written before the fix must fail on its own assertion. If it fails on setup or lookup, the test is broken, not the code. Read the failure message.
- Assertions on shipped data use exact counts (`== 746`), never floors (`>=`). A change updates the number on purpose.

## testing/standalone-checkout

# Tests Run From a Standalone Checkout

CI checks out each repo alone (`work/<repo>/<repo>`). The devcontainer's sibling layout (`/workspaces/firestarter_fw` next to `firestarter_app`) hides cross-repo dependencies.

```python
_APP_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent   # never cwd, never an env var
_DB_FILE = _APP_ROOT / "firestarter" / "data" / "chip_database.json"
```

- A test reads only files inside its own repo. Never a sibling repo, the meta repo or `.planning/`.
  `firestarter_fw/tests/test_flash_path_record_sync.py::test_no_test_reads_outside_this_repo`
  enforces this by parsing every `tests/*.py` with `ast`.
- Resolve paths from `Path(__file__)`.
- To check "inside repo X", use `Path.is_relative_to()`, never a name substring.
- Never write a test that skips when a sibling is absent. In CI it never runs.

Before you trust a new test, run it in a fresh clone of that repo only. The clone sees committed files only.

```bash
git clone /workspaces/firestarter_app "$SCRATCH/app" && cd "$SCRATCH/app"
export UV_CACHE_DIR="$SCRATCH/uv-cache"          # default cache is not writable
uv venv --python 3.11 .venv                      # CI runs 3.11; devcontainer has 3.12
VIRTUAL_ENV=.venv uv pip install -e '.[test]' && .venv/bin/pytest tests/
```

Use a new venv. The devcontainer's editable install still points at `/workspaces`.

## testing/no-source-introspection

# No Source Introspection

A test exercises production code with data. It never reads source text and asserts on its contents, whether by regex, substring or `ast`. This applies in all repos.

| Allowed | Forbidden |
|---|---|
| Call production functions; assert on results | Read `.py` `.c` `.h` `.cpp` `.md` `.yml` `.toml` and assert on the text |
| Read shipped data (`firestarter/data/*.json`, `pinouts.json`) | `ast` walks of production modules |
| Native Unity tests that run firmware code | Tests that parse another repo's source |

Why: source scanners fail open. A rename makes them skip or match zero times, and nothing goes red.

- If a hazard cannot be observed by a test, make it true by construction: codegen from one source (like `tools/catalog/`), a single shared definition, `static_assert` / `#error`.
- Host/firmware parity comes from codegen, not from a parity test.
- The source contracts in `firestarter_fw/tests/` are legacy, pending removal. Add none, do not extend them, and remove one when you touch it.
