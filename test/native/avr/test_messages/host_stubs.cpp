 * Phase 6 — host stub TU for the test_messages suite.
 * Phase 6 WR-06 — shared stub body lives in ../_shared/host_stubs_common.inc.
 *
 * test_messages stubs the host-side AVR-only symbols that
 * boards/rurp_serial_utils.cpp indirectly references. The widened
 * [env:native] src_filter pulls the real TU into the test binary so the
 * production CRC8 table, MAGIC_PREAMBLE, and _firestarter_emit_frame are
 * exercised end-to-end. (messages.c was a 256-byte PROGMEM byte-count
 * table backing MSG_PARAM_COUNT; it had no firmware callers and was
 * deleted post-Phase-7 to reclaim ~256 B of Leonardo flash.)
 *
 * Suite-specific extensions: NONE — test_messages uses the canonical
 * default for every stub. This TU is a pure pass-through to the shared
 * include (with one extra header pull for ArduinoFake's Serial_ class
 * definition, required by the shared file's link-only `Serial_::operator
 * bool()`).
