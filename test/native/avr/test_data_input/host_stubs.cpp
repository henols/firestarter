 * Phase 28 Wave A — host stub TU for the test_data_input suite.
 *
 * This suite uses the include-as-source pattern (the test cpp #includes
 * leonardo_rurp_shield.cpp directly per RESEARCH.md Q2 Option D) and defines
 * PORTx/DDRx/PINx as test-local globals. The shared host stubs include file
 * under _shared/ is INTENTIONALLY NOT INCLUDED because:
 *   1. test_data_input does not link src/proms/*.cpp (it doesn't need the
 *      dispatch surface).
 *   2. The included leonardo_rurp_shield.cpp provides real implementations
 *      of rurp_set_data_input, rurp_read_data_buffer, rurp_set_data_output,
 *      rurp_write_data_buffer, rurp_set_control_pin, rurp_board_setup, and
 *      rurp_user_button_pressed — which would multiple-define against the
 *      shared stubs.
 *
 * The only host stub content needed is the Serial bool-cast operator (a
 * link-only stub referenced indirectly through ArduinoFake's USB-CDC
 * surface — used inside leonardo_rurp_shield.cpp's rurp_board_setup, which
 * the tests never call but the linker still resolves).

 * Since we cannot include the shared inc (would multiple-define
 * rurp_set_data_input / rurp_read_data_buffer against the real Leonardo
 * implementations pulled into the test cpp via #include-as-source), we

 *
 * Each stub is intentionally a no-op — the data_input tests never assert on
 * voltage / hardware-revision / config behavior. They only exist so the
