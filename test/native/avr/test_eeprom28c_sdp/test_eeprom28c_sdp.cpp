 * Phase 116 Plan 06 authored this suite PARKED and RED-by-design
 * (v1.22 Phase 116 Plan 06, TRACE-02/TRACE-04/TRACE-06). As of v1.22 Phase
 * 117 commit 1 (D-03), the suite is ENABLED in platformio.ini's
 * [env:native] test_filter and runs under `pio test -e native`.
 *
 * This suite pins the exact ordered (LSB, MSB, data, CE) stream
 * eeprom28c_write_init emits, for each of the four 0x0D pinouts plus a
 * second DIP32 size band, and asserts it against the FIXED (post-Phase-117)
 * target — TRACE-02. At Phase 117 commit 1 it is RED against the
 * still-unfixed production tree; the verbatim capture is committed at
 * RED-BASELINE.md under "## Post-suite-edit RED baseline (Phase 117 commit
 * 1 — D-03)". It is GREEN from commit 2 onward, once plan 117-02 lands the
 * production fix.
 *
 * Phase 116's D-01 claimed that this suite's one-line test_filter addition
 * would itself BE the whole RED-to-GREEN proof. That did not hold
 * (117-CONTEXT.md D-01/D-02/D-03 supersede it): two structural conflicts
 * would have kept the suite RED post-fix for reasons unrelated to the fix —
 * the suite's own no-op `set_data` mock (the exact pointer FIX-01's emitter
 * is built on) and five assertions that encoded today's INIT-abort as the
 * expected outcome. The real flip required four edits: this test_filter
 * line, un-mocking `set_data` (D-01), flipping five response-code
 * assertions plus adding one new permanent severity-preservation regression
 * case (D-02), and this file's own suite-header rewrite.
 *
 * Cases 6-7 additionally carry TRACE-06's re-runnable evidence: with
 * CORRECTION 2's fix applied (D-12 originally mis-routed one of these two
 * into the always-green harness), both migrated identity-gate cases assert
 * the post-fix expectation — a matching identity must proceed, and a
 * FLAG_FORCE mismatch's WARNING severity must survive the completion path
 * (D-05: the completion poll never writes response_code). Case 8 is new at
 * Phase 117 commit 1: a permanent regression case proving the completion
 * poll can never destroy a prior WARNING, even when it never settles.
 *
 * Cases 9-12 are new at Phase 118 Plan 05 (D-08, OBS-02/OBS-03/OBS-05),
 * driving PRODUCTION eeprom28c_write_init via configure_memory dispatch
 * (never the harness's drive_reference_emitter):
 *  - Case 9: FLAG_SKIP_SDP_UNLOCK set -- the unlock sequence is provably
 *    absent from the recorded BUS stream, asserted on content and position
 *    (exact divergence index 0, plus an explicit walk over recorded
 *    STROBE_KIND_DATA values for EEPROM_SDP_DISABLE's own payload bytes),
 *    never on a bare strobe count.
 *  - Case 10: the flag-absent counterpart, from the SAME handle factory as
 *    Case 9, asserting the full SDP_FIXED_DIP28_28C256 stream -- the pair
 *    ships together so the contrast is one executable comparison.
 *  - Case 11: the t_BLC runtime budget WARN is observed to actually FIRE
 *    (an over-budget synthesised elapsed value via Plan 118-03's
 *    s_micros_ticks seam) and observed to NOT fire under the default
 *    elapsed value -- the anti-hollow pair for a check that would otherwise
 *    be indistinguishable from a dead branch.
 *  - Case 12: the exactly-two-new-serial-frames enumeration (and its
 *    exactly-one-WARN skip-path mirror), via a per-case Serial-frame
 *    capture reusing test_rurp_log_id.cpp's existing AlwaysDo idiom -- NOT
 *    a new general-purpose recorder (D-07 explicitly declined building
 *    one). This strengthens, but never replaces, D-07's PRIMARY assertion:
 *    the recorded BUS stream's byte-identity (Cases 1-3/10 here, and the
 *    _shared/ blob-SHA check in RED-BASELINE.md).
 *
 * Validation ceiling (RED-BASELINE.md carries this in full): every claim
 * this suite embodies is software-layer — code emits a sequence, code
 * asserts on it. No AT28C part was ever on the bench, and nothing here is
 * evidence about silicon state.

 * CORRECTION 3 (116-RESEARCH.md CORRECTION 3 / 116-05-SUMMARY.md): a PLAIN
 * DIP32 trace against the canonical zero-CONTROL-seed SDP_FIXED_DIP32_*
 * target is decorative here. mem_util_remap_address_bus returns 0x5555
 * unchanged for this pinout (address_mask == 0xFFFF, rw_line-20's bit is
 * WRITE_FLAG == 0 on a write) -- shipped and fixed share byte-identical
 * LSB/MSB/data values under a zero seed, differing only by an INCIDENTAL
 * /OE-edge ordering artifact of which emitter function happens to be used. A
 * future fix that preserved that ordering would leave a plain trace GREEN
 * with nothing about the real bug proven.
 *
 * The REAL bug: DIP32's rw_line (20) folds into CONTROL bit 0x10
 * (CTRL_ADDRESS_LINE_17) -- the WRITE-ENABLE line this 32-pin pinout
 * repurposes an upper address line for. fu_flash_fast_address (the SHIPPED
 * emitter) writes ONLY LSB/MSB and NEVER writes CONTROL_REGISTER at all -- so
 * whatever a PRECEDING operation left in CONTROL's upper-address bits stays
 * stuck for the entire SDP sequence: /WE inhibited, and (for
 * CTRL_ADDRESS_LINE_18) the chip's real upper address wrong. The reference
 * emitter (memory_set_data, the FIX-01 target) recomputes and writes
 * CONTROL_REGISTER on every address change via mem_util_set_address, and
 * WOULD clear those stale bits.
 *
 * Non-decorative comparison target: instead of the canonical zero-seed
 * SDP_FIXED_DIP32_28C512_EEPROM array, both cases below dynamically drive the
 * reference emitter under the SAME stale seed as the shipped path, snapshot
 * it, and assert the shipped stream equals THAT snapshot. This is the
 * "large, unambiguous divergence" CORRECTION 3 calls for: shipped emits no
 * CONTROL_REGISTER entries under any seed (cache-hit branch is a no-op either
 * way), while the stale-seeded reference emitter emits an EXTRA
 * CONTROL_REGISTER write clearing the stale bits -- a difference in KIND, not
 * merely incidental ordering. It is also self-repairing: once Phase 117
 * rebuilds eeprom28c_write_init on the same remap-aware, CONTROL-writing
 * emitter, driving the "shipped" handle will produce byte-identical output to
 * driving the reference handle, and this assertion passes with no further
 * edit.
