 * (VPP-01..VPP-04, D-14) -- host stubs for the EPROM VPP-routing
 * and VPP-validation suite.
 *
 * This is the SECOND suite compiled into the native_loop_v131 env (no
 * seventh env is created -- see platformio.ini's Phase 142 addendum on that
 * env). It composes FOUR independent, pre-existing opt-in recorder layers
 * from the shared stub base, plus two suite-local additions (an extended
 * read-back model and a logged-id capture) that do not exist anywhere else
 * in the tree in this combination:
 *
 *   - HOST_STUBS_REAL_REGISTER_UTILS (Phase 116): the ordered strobe
 *     recorder, driving production's REAL rurp_register_utils.h so the
 *     cache-compare elision and latch-strobe sequencing this suite's
 *     assertions depend on is the genuine article, never a hand-maintained
 *     replica that could silently drift.
 *   - HOST_STUBS_RECORD_TIMING (Phase 138): the timing recorder. Its
 *     sequence key is s_strobe_count, so it can only ever compose WITH
 *     HOST_STUBS_REAL_REGISTER_UTILS above (the shared stub base fails
 *     closed with a #error if this is requested alone).
 *   - HOST_STUBS_CUSTOM_READ_DATA_BUFFER: opts this suite out of the shared
 *     base's default (always-0) rurp_read_data_buffer, so this file can
 *     supply its OWN stateful, 16-bit-address-keyed model instead (below),
 *     extended with a mismatch window (point 5 in the plan).
 *   - HOST_STUBS_CUSTOM_VOLTAGE_MV (new to this suite): opts out of the
 *     shared base's default (always-0) rurp_read_voltage_mv, so this file
 *     can inject an arbitrary VPP millivolt reading per case -- required to
 *     drive eprom_check_vpp's over-voltage and under-voltage compares at
 *     all (VPP-04).
 *
 * PITFALL 1, restated: the register-cache globals (lsb_address, msb_address,
 * control_register, declared in include/rurp_register_utils.h) are
 * non-static and 0xff-initialised. They persist across Unity test cases in
 * this single binary, and the 0xff CONTROL value ORs a VPP-regulator bit
 * (CTRL_VPP_REGULATOR_ENABLE, 0x80) into the FIRST address write of any case
 * that does not reset them. Every case must reset the cache deliberately
 * before driving anything (reset_register_cache, below).
 *
 * PITFALL 2, restated: every opt-in guard above MUST be defined BEFORE the
 * shared stub base is included below -- each is read at include time, and a
 * #define written after the include silently does nothing.
 *
 * Why HOST_STUBS_RECORD_BUS (the shared base's OTHER, older recorder) is
 * unusable for this suite, for two independent reasons (F-141-09): it
 * stores `(uint8_t)data`, which truncates the 0x100 wide-variant drop bit to
 * zero before this suite could ever observe it; and it records CALLS to
 * rurp_write_to_register rather than STROBES below the cache-compare
 * elision, so an elided (unchanged-value) write is invisible to it -- a
 * green assertion built on it could be evidence of nothing.
 *
 * Because HOST_STUBS_REAL_REGISTER_UTILS defines the wider suppression block
 * that removes all four hardware-revision stubs from the shared base, the
 * REAL rurp_get_hardware_revision() is linked in this suite, and it returns
 * rurp_get_config()->hardware_revision -- which is 0 (REVISION_0) by default
 * from the shared base's zero-initialised config struct. Every case that
 * cares about the drop bit's per-revision physical mapping, or about
 * reaching eprom_check_vpp's voltage compare at all (Rev 0 takes an early
 * return there), must override rurp_get_config()->hardware_revision per
 * case. This suite does NOT opt into any narrower revision-override guard --
 * there is nothing for one to do once the wider suppression block above is
 * active.

 * 16-bit-latched-address-keyed read-back model, WITH a mismatch window.
 *
 * Derivation of the key (source-verified against src/proms/memory.cpp, not
 * assumed): for this suite's 32-pin VPP_BUS_CONFIG_0x08, matching_lines is
 * 17 and static_high_mask is 0. mem_util_remap_address_bus starts from
 * `config.address_mask & address` and only perturbs bits at index >=
 * matching_lines (here, bit 17 and up); bits 0-16 are therefore left
 * IDENTITY-mapped for every address this suite drives. Bit 16 (A16) is
 * carried by mem_util_calculate_top_address_register's CTRL_ADDRESS_LINE_16
 * bit in the CONTROL top-address register, NOT by the LSB/MSB latches -- so
 * the LSB/MSB pair alone carries exactly the low 16 bits, and
 *     rurp_read_from_register(LEAST_SIGNIFICANT_BYTE)
 *     | (rurp_read_from_register(MOST_SIGNIFICANT_BYTE) << 8)
 * equals `address & 0xFFFF` for every byte of a block, including a block
 * based anywhere other than address 0.
 *
 * Read-count-to-pulse-count mapping (unchanged from the sibling suite's
 * model): the write loop reads FIRST (the skip check) and only then pulses,
 * so seeding `converge_after = N` means the byte matches on read `N+1`, i.e.
 * after exactly N pulses -- vpp_readback_reads(addr) == 1 + pulses. A byte
 * that is skipped entirely under the 0xFF rule is never read at all, so its
 * read count stays 0.
 *
 * Mismatch-window mapping (NEW -- this is what the sibling suite's
 * unbounded model cannot express, and is exactly the shape VPP-02's X4 leg
 * (MSG_ERR_VERIFY, eprom.cpp) needs): once a byte's read_count reaches
 * mismatch_from, it stops matching again -- the sequence by read_count is
 *   [0, converge_after)        -> 0xFF          (not yet converged)
 *   [converge_after, mismatch_from) -> target    (converged, matches)
 *   [mismatch_from, infinity)  -> bitwise-NOT of target (diverges again)
 * Seed mismatch_from = 0xFFFF (the NEVER-MISMATCH sentinel) to recover the
 * sibling suite's original unbounded-convergence behaviour -- no case in
 * this suite drives anywhere near 65535 reads of one address, so that
 * sentinel is safe in practice.
