 * host stub TU for the test_val_eprom Tier-1 suite.
 * WR-06 — shared stub body lives in ../_shared/host_stubs_common.inc.
 *
 * Suite-specific extensions:
 *   - HOST_STUBS_RECORD_BUS: activate the recording buffer so the test can
 *     observe all rurp_write_to_register calls and assert VPP-enable CTL bits.
 *   - HOST_STUBS_CUSTOM_HW_REVISION: override hardware revision to return 1
 *     (non-REV0) so eprom_check_vpp does NOT take the REVISION_0 early-return
 *     path — the VPP write that the positive test asserts WILL fire.
 *
 * PITFALL 1 (from 71-PATTERNS.md): HOST_STUBS_RECORD_BUS MUST be defined
 * BEFORE #include of host_stubs_common.inc — the guard reads at include time.

 * Debug session w27c512-write-slow-3x -- stateful read-back model, so this
 * suite can drive the REAL eprom_write_execute loop (not just its init) and
 * count program-route asserts.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES IN THIS SUITE AND NOT IN test_loop_eprom_v131 / test_trace_
 * eprom_v131, which already have richer harnesses: CI (.github/workflows/
 * build.yml:142,155 and beta-build.yml:122,128) runs ONLY `pio test -e
 * native` and `-e native_nodevtools`. Neither runs native_loop_v131,
 * native_trace_v131, native_params_v131 or native_pinmap_provisional, and
 * neither runs check_size_baseline.py. An assertion placed in any of those
 * envs is decorative -- a branch carrying the per-byte regression would
 * merge green. test_val_eprom is in BOTH pinned envs' test_filter, so the
 * cadence invariant is enforced here or nowhere.
 *
 * HOST_STUBS_CUSTOM_READ_DATA_BUFFER opt-out (declared above the shared
 * include, as that guard is read at include time): the shared default
 * returns 0 for every read, so any non-zero target byte never verifies and
 * the loop burns max_pulses on every byte -- which both saturates the
 * 256-entry recorder and destroys the pass-count arithmetic the cases below
 * assert on.
 *
 * BYTE-INDEX DERIVATION. Same reasoning as test_trace_eprom_v131's model,
 * different mechanism: that suite defines HOST_STUBS_REAL_REGISTER_UTILS and
 * so has a real register cache to read the latched LSB back out of. This
 * suite deliberately does NOT (it needs the plain recording
 * rurp_write_to_register, which records EVERY call with no cache-compare
 * elision -- exactly what makes a route-assert count trustworthy here), and
 * the shared stub's rurp_read_from_register always returns 0. So the index
 * is recovered by scanning the recording backwards for the most recent
 * LEAST_SIGNIFICANT_BYTE write. That is valid for a block based at address 0
 * because LOOP_BUS_CONFIG_0x07 leaves address bits 0-7 identity-mapped:
 * mem_util_remap_address_bus's per-line remap loop starts at
 * config.matching_lines (16), and that config's static_high_mask and
 * vpp_line are 0 and 0xFF, so nothing can perturb a bit below bit 8.
 *
 * The statics below are visible because host_stubs_common.inc is TEXTUALLY
 * included into this TU, so its file-static recorder is in scope here.
