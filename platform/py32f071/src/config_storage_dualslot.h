/*
 * Phase 126 (CFG-05, decisions D-02/D-03/D-15/D-16/D-17/D-19) -- the HAL-free
 * dual-slot config storage core. This is the algorithm that scans, validates,
 * selects and alternates over two flash slots; it never touches a register
 * and never includes a HAL header.
 *
 * WHY INJECTED PRIMITIVES (D-02):
 *   This algorithm is compiled TWICE from this ONE source file: once linked
 *   against the real PY32 HAL (platform/py32f071/src/config_storage_flash.cpp
 *   supplies the primitives, Plan 126-08), and once linked against a RAM fake
 *   in tests/test_config_storage_dualslot.py (Plan 126-09). The tested code
 *   is therefore the shipped code. Two alternatives were considered and
 *   rejected: an independent fake reimplementation living only in the test
 *   (rejected -- it proves a copy behaves, the exact hollow-gate shape Phases
 *   118 and 124 each had to unwind); and compiling the real backend against a
 *   hand-written stub HAL header for the test to link against (rejected --
 *   the stub becomes an unversioned mirror of the pinned FetchContent SDK
 *   that the test venue cannot see, so it can silently drift from the real
 *   HAL's actual contract).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS HAL-FREE AND UNGUARDED:
 *   No HAL include and no platform `#error` guard appears anywhere below,
 *   because the host test harness compiles this file directly with a bare
 *   host g++. The `#error` platform guard belongs in the HAL glue TU
 *   (config_storage_flash.cpp), never here (126-PATTERNS.md).
 *
 * RECORD FORMAT IS VENDORED (D-17):
 *   The six-field layout below comes verbatim from blob `4b1a441`
 *   (platform/py32f071/CONFIG-STORAGE.md), and `rurp_configuration_t` is
 *   embedded byte-for-byte, unmodified by this phase -- which is what makes
 *   CFG-07's "schema unchanged" structurally true rather than merely
 *   asserted in prose. The wrapper's `version` field is NOT `CONFIG_VERSION`
 *   (the `char[6]` literal "VER06" living inside `rurp_configuration_t`
 *   itself, include/rurp_shield.h:46) and must never be "reconciled" with it.
 *
 * COMMIT SEMANTICS -- D-16 AS AMENDED BY C-2:
 *   D-16's locked wording -- "erase the inactive slot, program the record
 *   body, program the header/CRC word LAST" -- names a step that cannot be
 *   executed on this part. `py32f071_hal_flash.h`'s `IS_FLASH_TYPEPROGRAM`
 *   accepts exactly one value (`FLASH_TYPEPROGRAM_PAGE`); `FLASH_Program_Page`
 *   writes 64 32-bit words unconditionally; RM V0.2 §4.2.3.2 hard-faults on
 *   any non-32-bit write. There is no primitive that writes a single trailing
 *   word. The amended shape, recorded in CONFIG-STORAGE.md, is what this core
 *   implements instead: erase the inactive slot, build the WHOLE 256-byte
 *   record (header and CRC included) in a 4-byte-aligned staging buffer, then
 *   issue ONE page program whose completion IS the commit. The active slot
 *   is never touched, so any interruption leaves the previous record
 *   loadable, and a page interrupted mid-burst fails CRC on the next load.
 *   There is no separate header-write, commit-word or final-word step
 *   anywhere in this core.
 *
 * VALIDATION ORDER (V5, load-bearing):
 *   Every byte read from either slot is UNTRUSTED INPUT: it may be blank
 *   (0xFF), garbage from a partial write, or a record left over from an
 *   unrelated firmware image. The mandatory order, each check gating the
 *   next, is `magic`, then `length` -- bounds-checked against the caller's
 *   buffer -- then `crc32`. A record whose `length` exceeds the caller's
 *   buffer is rejected BEFORE any copy is made; the CRC does not substitute
 *   for this bound check, because anyone able to write flash can recompute a
 *   matching CRC over whatever content they choose.
 *
 * SIZES ARE SYMBOLIC (C-6):
 *   Host `long` is 8 bytes; the target's is 4. `sizeof(StoredConfiguration)`
 *   therefore measures 48 / 31 / 36 bytes on host / AVR / (computed) ARM, and
 *   `g++ -m32` is unavailable in this environment to reproduce a 32-bit host
 *   figure. The only absolute claim anywhere in this core is the relational
 *   `sizeof(StoredConfiguration) <= 256`; no literal size or field offset may
 *   be written anywhere in this file or its implementation.
 *
 * FIRE-PROOF:
 *   tests/test_config_storage_dualslot.py (Plan 126-09) exercises this core
 *   directly (the six named behaviours plus the CRC known-answer vector).
 *   tests/test_py32_flash_map.py gates the flash map this core addresses
 *   (slot addresses, page size, erase-unit separation).

 *   version       -- written as the literal 1. No reader branches on this
 *                     field yet, and a version-dispatch branch must NOT be
 *                     added: it could never execute and could never be
 *                     tested. It exists so a future schema change has
 *                     somewhere to record its own generation -- a future
 *                     phase's problem, not this one's.
 *   length        -- the length, in bytes, of `configuration` as written.
 *                     Gives forward compatibility and makes a cross-width
 *                     read detectable rather than silently misparsed. This
 *                     is the single most dangerous field in the record: it
 *                     arrives from flash and is used as a copy bound on a
 *                     Cortex-M0+ with 16 KiB of SRAM and no MPU configured.

 *                     endurance bounds the write count many orders of
 *                     magnitude below 2^32, so a rollover branch could never
 *                     execute and could never be tested.
 *   crc32         -- validates the record. Checked LAST, after `magic` and
 *                     the `length` bound, never before either.
