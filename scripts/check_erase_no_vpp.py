"""scripts/check_erase_no_vpp.py -- Phase 153 / ERASE-04 GATE-03 primary
control: a brace-matched negative source scan proving
`eeprom28c_erase_execute`'s body never reaches a VPP/VPE control-register
write, a chip-enable/disable bracket, or a bus-config-bypassing flash_utils
helper.

Requirements: ERASE-04
Decisions covered: D-153-03

**The mechanism correction this checker exists to fix (D-153-03).** The
ROADMAP's criterion 3 implies the host repository's `tools/check_dispatch.py`
(the Python-host sibling project) is what stops the datasheet's hardware
Chip Erase mode (12V on the OE pin,
AT28C256 DS20006386B Table 6-1) from reaching a `0x0D` chip. It is not, and
it cannot be: `check_dispatch.py`'s GATE-03 guard fires only on a
`handler == "configure_eprom"` paired with a no-VPP-pin pinout
(`no_vpp_pin_pinouts`, built from the pinout file) -- a database-and-
dispatch-table scan. It is structurally unable to observe a control-register
write inside a C++ handler body; `eeprom28c_erase_execute` is entirely
outside that Python checker's field of view. **A green `check_dispatch.py`
must never be cited as a VPP proof for this operation.** This module is the
primary control instead: a brace-matched scan of the erase body's own
source text.

**Proximity, not absence, is the risk.** The hardware 12V-on-OE erase path
already exists in this tree today, at `firestarter/src/proms/flash_5v_page.cpp`
lines 196-231 (`flash_5v_page_erase_execute`, which asserts
`CTRL_VPE_ENABLE` and the VPP boost regulator around a `rurp_chip_enable()`
/ `rurp_chip_disable()` bracket) -- in the very file an executor also edits
during this phase (ERASE-02). Copying that shape into `eeprom_28c.cpp`'s
erase handler by mistake is exactly the failure mode this checker exists to
catch, which is why the scan is body-scoped rather than a whole-file
zero-occurrence grep: `eeprom_28c.cpp` legitimately contains the same
tokens in `eeprom28c_check_chip_id` (the A9-12V chip-identification path),
so a file-wide scan would be RED on arrival against a function this checker
is not meant to guard.

**Body-scoped, not file-wide.** `--function` (default
`eeprom28c_erase_execute`) is located by its definition (signature followed
by `{`, never the semicolon-terminated forward declaration a few lines
above it in the real file) and brace-matched to its closing `}`. Only that
span is scanned.

**Comments are scanned too, deliberately.** Unlike this checker's sibling in
the host repository's tooling, `check_no_log_in_sdp_window.py` (which blanks
comments before scanning), this checker does NOT strip comments from the hazard
scan: a comment naming a hazard token inside the matched body is
indistinguishable, at grep distance, from a real call, and this project has
already been bitten by comment text invalidating its own gate. Comments
ARE still blanked for the purpose of locating the function definition and
brace-matching its body (so a stray `{` or `}` inside a comment cannot
desynchronize the brace counter) -- but the reported violation text is read
back from the original, uncleaned source, at the same character offsets
(the comment-blanking transform is length- and newline-preserving, so
offsets never drift between the two views).

**Non-vacuity anchor -- but only on the PASS path.** A checker that can
only ever pass proves nothing (v1.12's hollow GATE-03 class). Before this
module reports a clean body as a PASS, it requires the matched body to
contain at least one `handle->firestarter_set_data(` call and at least one
`delay(AT28C_TEC_MAX_MS)` call -- the two source-level fingerprints of the
real AN-0544B six-byte software chip erase this checker exists to guard.
Hazard-token violations are reported unconditionally, ahead of the anchor
check: `eeprom28c_check_chip_id` (the discrimination fixture) has neither
anchor either, but it is still reported as a violation rather than an
anchor failure, because the token scan runs first and finds real hazard
tokens in that body. The anchor check only gates the *empty* or *wrong*
body case -- one that reports no violations only because it is not the
erase op at all.

**Fails closed, never open.** A missing source file, an unresolvable
function definition, an unbalanced brace count, or a failed non-vacuity
anchor is never a silent pass: each prints an `ERROR:` message and exits 2.
A hazard-token violation prints a `FAIL:` message and exits 1 -- a
different exit code from every fail-closed case, so the paired pytest
(`tests/test_check_erase_no_vpp.py`) can tell "found a real hazard" apart
from "could not render a trustworthy verdict at all", mirroring
`check_no_log_in_sdp_window.py`'s own `ERROR:` versus `FAIL:` distinction.

**No dependency, no other-repo scan.** stdlib only. This module never reads
anything under the Python-host sibling repository's tree and never weakens,
exempts, or re-baselines anything in its `tools/` directory -- the host
repo's `check_dispatch.py` stays byte-unchanged by this phase;
`git diff --quiet -- tools/check_dispatch.py`, run from that repository,
must hold at phase end, independently of this checker's own result.

**No CI leg.** This module -- and its paired pytest -- executes in NO CI
leg on this branch: `build.yml` and `beta-build.yml` run only
`pio test -e native` and `pio test -e native_nodevtools`; neither invokes
`pytest` over `firestarter/tests/` at all. The phase record (this plan's
SUMMARY.md) is the only evidence this checker was ever exercised, exactly
like `check_size_baseline.py`'s own standing disclosure.

Path resolution is always relative to this script's own location, never to
the caller's current working directory -- `--source` (default
`src/proms/eeprom_28c.cpp`) and any value passed to it are resolved against
the repository root derived from `__file__`, so `python3
/path/to/scripts/check_erase_no_vpp.py` behaves identically regardless of
the shell's cwd.

Exit codes:
  0 -- the matched body contains zero hazard-token occurrences AND both
       non-vacuity anchors are present (PASS:, naming the file, the
       function, the resolved body line range and the scanned line count).
  1 -- at least one hazard-token occurrence was found in the matched body
       (FAIL:, per-violation summary with line numbers and the offending
       source line).
  2 -- fail-closed: the source file is missing or unreadable, the function
       definition could not be located or brace-balanced, or (only when
       zero hazard tokens were found) a required non-vacuity anchor is
       absent (ERROR:, naming the specific failure).
