"""scripts/check_no_heap_or_64bit_symbols.py -- Phase 155 Plan 02 / DEAD-01,
DEAD-03 link-time symbol-absence gate.

Requirements: DEAD-01, DEAD-03

Asserts, by reading the LINKED ELF's symbol table (never source text), that
none of the AVR targets named in the recorded baseline's `avr_targets` keys
carries a heap-allocator symbol or a 64-bit-runtime-division symbol. DEAD-01
and DEAD-03 are link-time properties: a source grep for `malloc(` or a
`uint64_t` declaration cannot see the linker. It would still pass while the
allocator was pulled in by a different translation unit, and it fails open
on inlining and renaming -- exactly what a size-reduction phase does. Only
the linked `.elf` can witness symbol absence. No script or test in either
repository has ever invoked a toolchain binary before this module; that
narrow capability is new and is documented below rather than silently
assumed.

**Why the listing is parsed in Python, not a shelled counting grep.** A
counting `grep -c PATTERN` prints `0` and *exits 1* when nothing matches --
and nothing matching is exactly this gate's SUCCESS case. Wrapping that in
`|| true` (155-RESEARCH.md's own illustrative sketch) throws away the one
signal that distinguishes "avr-nm itself failed" from "avr-nm found zero
matches", which is precisely the fail-open/fail-closed inversion this module
exists to avoid. Every symbol-table line is instead parsed with `str.split()`
in this module, and the resulting exit code is chosen deliberately by this
script's own logic, never inherited from a shell pipeline's exit status.

**This is not backlog 999.15 / gh#8's "avr-nm symbol capture" todo.**
`platformio.ini` records that todo as deliberately not attempted (Phase 119).
Locating and invoking the AVR toolchain here is a narrow, unrelated use --
proving the absence of ELEVEN named symbols across three ELFs -- and must
not be presented as discharging that broader, differently-scoped backlog
item.

**OQ-2 (locked): all ELEVEN 64-bit symbols are asserted, not the eight
DEAD-03's requirement text names.** The eight named symbols (`__muldi3`,
`__muldi3_6`, `__umoddi3`, `__udivdi3`, `__udivdi3_umoddi3`, `__udivmod64`,
`__lshrdi3`, `__adddi3`) sum to exactly 438 B. But the image contains three
more symbols in the SAME contiguous 0x6036-0x6246 blob that the requirement
text omits: `__umulsidi3` (2 B), `__umulsidi3_helper` (84 B) and `__ashrdi3`
(4 B) -- 90 B total. The full eleven-symbol blob sums to exactly 528 B. A
gate over only the eight named symbols could therefore PASS while 90 B of
64-bit runtime is still linked, if some future caller pulled only
`__umulsidi3_helper` (or either of its two companions) back in. This module
asserts on all eleven for that reason; both totals (438 B named-subset,
528 B full blob) are recorded here as this gate's own documentation, per
`.planning/v1.33/155-before-figures.md` section 4.

Two env seams, both read with committed defaults, both overridable by an
argv flag (argv wins over env, env wins over the default) -- the same
precedence convention as `check_release_assets.py`:

  - `FIRESTARTER_SIZE_BASELINE` (reused from `check_release_assets.py`;
    default `scripts/baseline/size_baseline.json`). READ ONLY: this gate
    derives only the `avr_targets` key set from it and never writes the
    file -- re-anchoring or rebuilding the baseline is LAND-01 / Phase 158's
    job, not this gate's.
  - `FIRESTARTER_PIO_BUILD_ROOT` (reused from `check_release_assets.py`;
    default `<repo>/.pio/build`). It exists for the identical recorded
    reason as `check_release_assets.py`'s own copy: `firestarter/.gitignore`
    line 1 is the bare pattern `.pio`, which matches at any depth, so a
    committed fixture cannot live under a real `.pio/build/...` path.

One new seam, with no precedent in either repository because locating an
AVR toolchain binary from a gate script is itself new:

  - `FIRESTARTER_AVR_NM` (default
    `$HOME/.platformio/packages/toolchain-atmelavr/bin/avr-nm`). This module
    never falls back to a bare `avr-nm` resolved off `$PATH` -- the seam's
    own default is an absolute path, and if that path is not present and
    executable, that IS the failure (exit 2), not a silent PATH search.

A fourth seam, `--nm-output TARGET=PATH` (repeatable), lets the gate read a
committed, captured TEXT listing for a target instead of invoking the
toolchain at all. This is the seam the paired pytest uses to stay hermetic
in CI leg 3, where no AVR toolchain need exist -- mirroring the dominant
fixture family in this repo (`captured_build_*.log`, `planted_size_baseline_*.log`
are all committed text captures of tool output, never binaries). No binary
ELF fixture is committed by this plan.

**House convention: a manual argv parser, not argparse.** `check_release_assets.py`
uses this shape and calls it house convention, mirroring `check_size_baseline.py`'s
own `_parse_argv`. (`check_erase_no_vpp.py` uses `argparse` instead -- both
precedents exist in this repo; the manual form is the majority idiom, and is
what this module follows.)

Exit codes:
  0 -- every resolved target's listing contains zero heap-set matches, zero
       64-bit-set matches, and both required non-vacuity anchors (PASS:,
       naming every target compared, its counts, and its listing source).
  1 -- at least one heap-set or 64-bit-set symbol was found, on any target
       (FAIL:, one indented line per violation naming the target, the
       symbol, its type and its size) -- OR the resolved target list is
       genuinely empty (the never-vacuous guard: a gate that requires
       nothing must not report success).
  2 -- fail-closed: the baseline could not be read/parsed, is not a JSON
       object, has no object-valued `avr_targets` key; a named `--nm-output`
       listing is missing or unreadable; an ELF is missing under the build
       root; `avr-nm` could not be resolved/invoked or exited non-zero; a
       zero-violation target is missing a required non-vacuity anchor
       (proving nothing, because the listing scanned may not be the real
       firmware); or the CLI invocation itself is malformed (unknown flag,
       a flag missing its value, or a malformed `--nm-output` value) -- a
       tool/format failure, categorically distinct from a real violation,
       and never silently reported as a pass.

Anti-hollow contract: this checker's mandatory paired pytest is
`tests/test_check_no_heap_or_64bit_symbols.py`, which invokes this script as
a real subprocess (list-form argv, never `shell=True`) against the committed
fixture `tests/fixtures/planted_no_heap_or_64bit_symbols_prechange_uno/avr-nm-uno.txt`
-- the VERBATIM `avr-nm` stdout for the real pre-change `uno` image, captured
at `FW_PRE_SHA` `2ad5b322a37ba4a88afd09cc946f5c4114e51483`, containing
exactly 7 heap-set matches and 11 sixty-four-bit-set matches and both
anchors. A passing pytest suite proves THIS script goes RED against a real
pre-change listing and reaches exit 0 on a clean one -- not merely that a
test asserts it should.

Non-claim: a green run proves that, for every target compared, the scanned
listing contains no heap-allocator symbol, no 64-bit-runtime-division
symbol, and both `mem_util_blank_check` and `rurp_read_voltage_mv` are
present in it. It proves nothing about whether that listing was produced by
a clean build, whether the underlying source was actually edited to remove
the allocator/64-bit calls (a symbol can vanish from a listing for reasons
unrelated to source correctness), or any board's runtime behaviour --
no AVR board is read by this script.
