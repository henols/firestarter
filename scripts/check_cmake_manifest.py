"""scripts/check_cmake_manifest.py — BASE-04 CMake source-list drift gate (Phase 123 Plan 04, D-06/D-07).

`platform/py32f071/CMakeLists.txt` (landed by Phase 124's MERGE-01/MERGE-02) names
three `set()` source lists with three incompatible path idioms (123-RESEARCH.md
"BASE-04: The Real CMake Manifest"):

  - FIRESTARTER_COMMON_SOURCES -- `"${REPOSITORY_ROOT}/src/..."` (16 entries),
    the shared firmware sources the ARM port re-compiles. This is the list
    BASE-04 exists to protect: today it names
    `"${REPOSITORY_ROOT}/src/proms/flash_type_3.cpp"` and
    `"${REPOSITORY_ROOT}/src/proms/flash_type_4.cpp"` -- both renamed by
    v1.19 Phase 104 to flash_nor_unlock.cpp / flash_5v_page.cpp. That is the
    confirmed MERGE-02 defect this gate exists to catch, and it must exist
    BEFORE the port lands so it CATCHES the rename damage rather than
    blessing it after the fact.
  - PY32_PLATFORM_SOURCES -- bare paths relative to platform/py32f071/ (7
    entries): the ARM-only sources (startup, main, HAL glue).
  - PY32_SDK_SOURCES -- `"${PY32_SDK_ROOT}/..."` (14 entries), where
    PY32_SDK_ROOT is a FetchContent download directory
    (py32f071_sdk_SOURCE_DIR) that exists only after a networked `cmake`
    configure. This list is STRUCTURALLY EXEMPT from resolution -- a
    property of FetchContent, NOT a PY32_EXCLUDED allow-list entry. A gate
    that resolved these paths would report 14 permanent violations with no
    defect present (123-RESEARCH.md Pitfall 6).

`target_include_directories` (which mixes all three path idioms) is
deliberately NOT parsed here -- a missing include directory is a
warning-class problem, not the rename-damage class BASE-04 targets. Do not
"complete" this gate by adding it.

Coarse-key arming (D-07). `platform/py32f071/` does not exist on this branch
yet -- it arrives with Phase 124's merge. `ARMED` is computed from whether
`<root>/platform/py32f071` is a DIRECTORY (never a manual flip constant): if
absent, this gate prints `UNARMED:` and exits 0 -- the correct state until
Phase 124 lands the port. Once armed, the manifest at
`platform/py32f071/CMakeLists.txt` MUST exist and MUST parse into at least
one enforced source; a missing or unparseable manifest under an armed key is
a hard failure (exit 2), never a silent UNARMED and never a skip -- a rename
INSIDE the port cannot disarm this gate, only deleting the whole
`platform/py32f071/` directory can, and that is not a silent event.

PY32_EXCLUDED allow-list (a new contract: this phase authors its format,
Phase 124 populates it). A commented line of the form

    # PY32_EXCLUDED: <path> -- <reason>

in the manifest allow-lists a firmware source under `src/` that is
deliberately NOT named in FIRESTARTER_COMMON_SOURCES. The reason segment is
MANDATORY -- an entry with a path but no stated reason is itself a
violation, because an allow-list without required reasons degrades into a
silencer. 123-RESEARCH.md's measured deliberate-omission set against `beta`
(Phase 124 wrote the first five lines verbatim; Plan 126-03 added the
sixth, for the new AVR config-storage backend TU split out of
src/rurp_config_utils.cpp):

    src/boards/uno_rurp_shield.cpp        -- AVR board impl, no ARM analogue
    src/boards/leonardo_rurp_shield.cpp   -- AVR board impl, no ARM analogue
    src/boards/rurp_common.cpp            -- AVR-specific common
    src/dev_tools.cpp                     -- DEV_TOOLS deliberately off on ARM (MERGE-08)
    src/rurp_config_utils.cpp             -- Phase 126 per-platform config backend
                                              split; THIS EXCLUSION WILL NEED
                                              REVISITING in Phase 126, it is not
                                              a permanent exclusion.
    src/boards/rurp_config_storage_eeprom.cpp -- AVR EEPROM backend, no ARM analogue

    NOTE on src/rurp_config_utils.cpp's entry above: its retirement (moving
    it INTO FIRESTARTER_COMMON_SOURCES) is deliberately DEFERRED to Plan
    126-08, in the same commit that deletes
    platform/py32f071/src/config.cpp. Promoting it while config.cpp still
    defines all four public config functions would give the ARM link two
    definitions of each of those four functions -- undetectable in this
    devcontainer (arm-none-eabi-gcc/cmake/ninja are absent, and
    py32f071.yml does not fire on a push to this branch), surfacing only in
    a later gated CI run. Plan 126-03 therefore lands ONLY the sixth
    exclusion line above; the first five lines, including this one, are
    untouched by that plan.

Exit codes:
  0 -- UNARMED (platform/py32f071/ absent), OR armed and every enforced
       source resolves, with every reverse-check tree omission covered by a
       reasoned PY32_EXCLUDED entry (gate passes)
  1 -- armed, and at least one enforced source is unresolvable, OR at least
       one PY32_EXCLUDED entry has no stated reason, OR at least one tree
       source under src/ is unnamed in FIRESTARTER_COMMON_SOURCES and
       uncovered by any reasoned PY32_EXCLUDED entry, OR the gate resolved
       zero enforced sources while armed (never-vacuous guard: an empty or
       unparsed source list must not look like a clean pass)
  2 -- armed but the manifest is missing or does not parse into at least one
       enforced source, OR the manifest contains a `set()` source list whose
       name is in neither ENFORCED_LISTS nor EXEMPT_LISTS (a configuration
       change this gate has not been taught about) -- a tool/config error,
       never silently reported as a pass

Anti-hollow contract: this checker's mandatory paired pytest is
`tests/test_check_cmake_manifest.py`, exercising the four fixture trees
under `tests/fixtures/` (`planted_cmake_manifest_missing_source/`,
`planted_cmake_manifest_excluded_no_reason/`, `clean_cmake_manifest_excluded/`,
`clean_unarmed_tree/`) via the `FIRESTARTER_MANIFEST_ROOT` env seam and a
real subprocess -- never an in-process import -- so a passing suite proves
this script itself fails the build on real rename damage, not merely that
the test asserts it should.

Non-claim: a green run proves every path the manifest NAMES resolves in the
tree, and every tree source not named is either structurally exempt or
carries a reasoned PY32_EXCLUDED entry. It does NOT prove the manifest names
everything the port needs, and it never configures or builds anything --
`cmake`, `ninja` and `arm-none-eabi-gcc` are all absent from this
devcontainer, so this gate is deliberately a TEXTUAL gate over the
manifest's own `set()` blocks.
