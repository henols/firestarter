"""scripts/check_landing_range.py -- MERGE-01 Criterion-1 landing-shape gate
(Phase 124 Plan 01, D-05/D-06).

Criterion 1 requires that `git log` on the integration branch show no commit
where the portability-macro files (`include/rurp_platform_compat.h`,
`include/avr/pgmspace.h`) are present without the full py32 stack
(`platform/py32f071/`) alongside them. A **true merge** of
`agent/py32f071-toolchain` replays five commits at which the portability
files exist and `platform/py32f071/` does not -- RESEARCH measured exactly
five: `52d6c1f`, `adb133a`, `b253092`, `c0c6695`, `532997c`. A **squash**
produces zero such commits, because the whole port lands atomically in one
commit. This defect class matters because a reader trusting the *final tree*
alone cannot see it -- the offending state is only reachable by walking
history, and Phase 124's own operator tie-breaker (123-CONTEXT `<specifics>`)
says Criterion 1 must be discharged by a script, not by a human eyeballing
`git log`.

Confirmed present/absent today. On the pre-landing `v1.23-py32f071-integration`
tree, `git rev-list <fork>..HEAD` is 14 commits, none of which carries either
portability marker -- the port has not landed yet, so this gate is expected
to PASS at `scanned=14, carrying=0, violations=0` until the landing commit(s)
are added.

Rejected alternative reading, recorded deliberately. A `--first-parent`
traversal would report ZERO violations for a true merge, because the five
replayed commits are reachable only through the merge's non-first-parent
side -- `--first-parent` walks past the merge commit itself and never visits
what it merged in. That is the WEAKER reading D-06 rejects: this checker
walks the FULL `git rev-list <fork>..HEAD` set (every commit reachable from
HEAD but not from the fork, via any parent), not `--first-parent`, so a true
merge cannot hide its five violating commits behind the merge topology.

Scan scope. Every commit in `git rev-list <fork>..HEAD` (the full set). For
each commit, for each marker in PORTABILITY_MARKERS, `git cat-file -e
<commit>:<marker>` tests whether that path exists in that commit's tree; if
so, `git rev-parse -q --verify <commit>:platform/py32f071` tests whether the
py32 stack directory also exists in that same tree. A marker present without
the stack is a violation.

Never-vacuous guard. If `scanned == 0` (the fork resolves to HEAD, or HEAD is
otherwise unreachable-forward of the fork), that is a FAIL, not a pass -- a
gate that scanned nothing must never look like a gate that scanned
everything and found it clean. This is enforced by the never-vacuous check
below, independent of the ancestor check in step 3.

Output: `PASS: {scanned} commit(s) scanned in <fork>..HEAD, {carrying}
carrying a portability marker, 0 violations` on a clean range -- the PASS
line NAMES what it found, so a run that scanned nothing cannot visually
resemble a clean run. `FAIL: N violation(s) in <fork>..HEAD:` followed by up
to 20 violation lines and a `... and M more` tail on a dirty range.

Non-claim: a green run proves the history SHAPE only -- every commit in the
scanned range that carries a portability marker also carries the py32 stack
in the same tree. It proves nothing about whether the port builds, links, or
is correct; that is MERGE-02's and Phase 124's other gates' job entirely.

Exit codes:
  0 -- scanned >= 1 commit and zero violations found (gate passes)
  1 -- scanned == 0 commits (never-vacuous guard), OR scanned >= 1 commit and
       at least one violation was found
  2 -- the configured fork ref does not resolve to a commit, OR the fork is
       not an ancestor of HEAD, OR a `git` invocation itself failed
       unexpectedly -- a tool/configuration error, never silently reported
       as a pass

Anti-hollow contract: this checker's mandatory paired pytest is
`tests/test_check_landing_range.py`, exercising two synthetic git
repositories built from scratch in `tmp_path` (a squashed landing and a
replayed/true-merge landing) via the `FIRESTARTER_RANGE_ROOT` /
`FIRESTARTER_RANGE_FORK` env seams and a real subprocess -- never an
in-process import -- so a passing suite proves this script itself
discriminates a squash from a replay, not merely that the test asserts it
should.
