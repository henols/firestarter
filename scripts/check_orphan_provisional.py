"""scripts/check_orphan_provisional.py -- BASE-05 orphan-provisional-macro
gate (Phase 123 Plan 05, D-06/D-07).

Every `RURP_*_PROVISIONAL`-style flag must have at least one consumer
outside its own `#define` line. A provisional pin-map placeholder that
compiles clean but is never actually gated by anything is exactly this
project's v1.18-class defect: an entire milestone (v1.18) traced back to one
mis-modelled pin, and a provisional flag with zero consumers is the same
failure mode one level up -- the flag that was SUPPOSED to force a review
before real hardware trusts the placeholder, silently doing nothing.

**Confirmed absent from `beta` today.** `grep -rn PROVISIONAL` over this
firmware tree returns nothing -- this gate ships UNARMED and exits 0 on the
real tree (123-RESEARCH.md "BASE-05: The Orphan Provisional Macro").

**Confirmed present with exactly ONE repo-wide hit on the py32 branch.**
`include/boards/py32f071_rurp_shield.h` defines both:

    37: #define RURP_PY32F071_PINMAP_CONFIGURED 1
    38: #define RURP_PY32F071_PINMAP_PROVISIONAL 1

and a repo-wide grep for RURP_PY32F071_PINMAP_PROVISIONAL returns exactly
one hit -- its own definition at line 38. So this gate has a known, real,
non-planted first firing: landed unchanged, Phase 124 cannot merge the port
without this gate blocking it, because the flag has zero consumers. That is
precisely MERGE-04's requirement (the provisional-pinmap refusal must
actually be able to fire) -- this gate is the enforcement arm that makes it
land wired instead of decorative.

**Note, separately, the sibling `_CONFIGURED` macro is NOT this gate's
concern.** `RURP_PY32F071_PINMAP_CONFIGURED` is `#define`d `1` at line 37 and
tested with `#if !RURP_PY32F071_PINMAP_CONFIGURED -> #error` at lines 71-73
of the SAME header -- so that `#error` is structurally dead (the macro can
never be anything but 1, so the negation can never be true). Fixing that is
MERGE-04's problem, not this gate's: `_CONFIGURED` is not a `_PROVISIONAL`
flag and this checker must NOT be widened to try to catch it. Widening the
match pattern to catch `_CONFIGURED` too would conflate two different
defect classes (an orphan warning flag vs. a dead compile-time guard) behind
one gate, which is exactly the kind of "helpful" scope creep that makes a
gate's failure message stop telling the reader what actually broke.

Coarse-key arming (D-07). `platform/py32f071/` does not exist on this branch
yet -- it arrives with Phase 124's merge. `ARMED` is computed from whether
`<root>/platform/py32f071` is a DIRECTORY (never a manual flip constant),
mirroring check_cmake_manifest.py's identical D-07 idiom exactly so the two
gates read as one pattern rather than two dialects. If absent, this gate
prints `UNARMED:` naming the absent directory and Phase 124, and exits 0.

**Rejected alternative reading, recorded deliberately.** BASE-05's scan is
repo-wide (see below) and would be semantically meaningful even without the
ARM port -- a `RURP_AVR_SOMETHING_PROVISIONAL` macro could appear tomorrow
in shared code. Two readings were considered:

  (a) Follow D-07 literally: UNARMED until platform/py32f071/ exists.
  (b) Always armed, but report "0 provisional macros found" as a pass.

Reading (a) was CHOSEN. Reading (b) was considered and REJECTED: an
always-armed gate would have to treat "zero provisional macros found" as a
pass, which is precisely the vacuous shape D-08's floor-count requirement
exists to forbid (a gate that always exits 0 on an empty tree looks
identical to a gate that is working correctly). Reconciling (b) with the
never-vacuous rule below would need a special case carved out of the
arming logic itself. Consistency with D-07's literal reading wins, and it
is what stops a later reader from "fixing" this gate by widening it to
always-armed.

Definition scan (repo-wide by design). `DEFINE_RE` matches a preprocessor
`#define` of an identifier named `RURP_`, followed by upper-case letters,
digits and underscores, ending in `_PROVISIONAL`, tolerating whitespace
between `#` and `define`. The scan covers `SCAN_DIRS` = include/, src/,
platform/, test/ (restricted to `SCAN_SUFFIXES` = .h, .hpp, .c, .cpp) --
the WHOLE firmware repo, not just platform/py32f071/. The `RURP_` prefix is
what bounds the pattern; restricting the scan to the platform directory
would miss a provisional flag introduced in SHARED code (include/ or src/),
which is the more dangerous case -- a provisional flag in a file every
platform compiles is a bigger blast radius than one confined to the new
ARM-only tree.

Consumer search. For each defined macro, every OTHER occurrence of the
identical identifier anywhere in the same directory set counts as a
consumer, EXCEPT: the defining line itself, any `#undef` of the macro
(`UNDEF_RE` exists purely to exclude this -- an `#undef` removes the flag,
it does not consume it as a gated behaviour), and any occurrence that
appears only inside a `//` or `/* */` comment (a comment naming the macro
documents it, it does not consume it -- counting a comment as a consumer
is the same class of false-negative as counting an `#undef`, per
123-RESEARCH.md's discriminating-fixture requirement). Comments are
stripped (newlines preserved, so line numbers stay valid) before the
consumer scan runs. A macro with zero consumers is a violation naming the
macro, its defining file and line, and stating what a real consumer would
look like (a `#if`/`#ifdef`/`#elif` test, or a direct reference in live
code) -- the message tells the reader how to fix it, not merely that it is
wrong.

Never-vacuous guard. If the gate is ARMED (platform/py32f071/ present) and
the definition scan finds ZERO `_PROVISIONAL` macros anywhere in the repo,
that is a FAILURE, not a pass: an armed key says a port with a provisional
pin map is present, and finding no provisional flag at all means either the
flag was renamed out of this pattern, or SCAN_DIRS/SCAN_SUFFIXES no longer
cover where it lives. Exit 1 naming which condition is suspected. This is
the single most important design decision in this checker, and it is the
reason rejected reading (b) above could never have been chosen: an
always-armed gate cannot take this position, because "zero found" would be
indistinguishable from its own default pass state.

Encoding and binary safety. Every scanned file is read as UTF-8 with
decoding errors replaced (`errors="replace"`), so one stray non-UTF-8 byte
in a source file cannot crash this gate into an unhandled traceback that a
CI caller might misread as "gate did not run" rather than "gate found a
violation". A file that cannot be opened at all (permissions, deleted
mid-scan) is a scan failure -- exit 2, never a silent skip of that file,
because silently skipping a file could hide the one file with the orphan
macro in it.

Output. `UNARMED:` + exit 0 when platform/py32f071/ is absent. `PASS:`
naming every provisional macro found and its consumer count, so a run that
scanned nothing cannot visually resemble a run that scanned everything and
found it clean. `FAIL:` bucketed with a 20-row cap, each row naming the
macro, its defining file:line, and what a consumer would look like.
`ERROR:` to stderr + exit 2 for scan/configuration failures (unreadable
file, scan directory missing while armed in an unexpected way).

Non-claim: a green run proves every `RURP_*_PROVISIONAL` flag found by this
scan is REFERENCED in live (non-comment) text somewhere outside its own
definition. It does NOT prove that reference is a working guard -- a
`#if RURP_..._PROVISIONAL` that is always true, or a reference inside dead
code, still counts as a consumer here. Proving the reference actually gates
behaviour is out of this gate's scope entirely.

Exit codes:
  0 -- UNARMED (platform/py32f071/ absent), OR armed and every
       `_PROVISIONAL` macro found has at least one consumer outside its own
       definition (gate passes)
  1 -- armed, and at least one `_PROVISIONAL` macro has zero consumers, OR
       armed and zero `_PROVISIONAL` macros were found at all
       (never-vacuous guard)
  2 -- a scan/configuration failure: a scan directory could not be read, or
       a file could not be decoded/opened -- a tool error, never silently
       reported as a pass

Anti-hollow contract: this checker's mandatory paired pytest is
`tests/test_check_orphan_provisional.py`, exercising the two fixture trees
under `tests/fixtures/` (`planted_orphan_provisional_macro/`,
`clean_orphan_provisional_consumed/`) plus the shared `clean_unarmed_tree/`
(from Plan 123-04) via the `FIRESTARTER_PROVISIONAL_ROOT` env seam and a
real subprocess -- never an in-process import -- so a passing suite proves
this script itself fails on a real orphaned macro, not merely that the test
asserts it should.
